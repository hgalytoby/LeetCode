You are given a string  `s`  consisting only of the characters  `'0'`  and  `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any  `'0'`  to  `'1'`  or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string  `"010"`  is alternating, while the string  `"0100"`  is not.

Return  _the  **minimum**  number of operations needed to make_  `s`  _alternating_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "0100"
Output: 1
Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already alternating.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1111"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
-   `s[i]`  is either  `'0'`  or  `'1'`.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        one_count = zero_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                one_count += s[i] == '1'
                zero_count += s[i] == '0'
            else:
                one_count += s[i] == '0'
                zero_count += s[i] == '1'
        return min(one_count, zero_count)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        count1 = count2 = 0
        for index, char in enumerate(s):
            if index % 2 == 0:
                if s[index] != '1':
                    count1 += 1
                else:
                    count2 += 1
            else:
                if s[index] != '1':
                    count2 += 1
                else:
                    count1 += 1
        return min(count1, count2)
