Given an binary array  `nums`  and an integer  `k`, return  `true` _if all_ `1`_'s are at least_ `k` _places away from each other, otherwise return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_1_1791.png)
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_2_1791.png)
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
-   `0 <= k <= nums.length`
-   `nums[i]`  is  `0`  or  `1`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        if 1 not in nums:
            return True
        first = last = nums.index(1)
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num == 1 and index != first:
                if index - 1 - last < k:
                    return False
                last = index
        return True
```
