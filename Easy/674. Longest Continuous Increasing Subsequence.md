Given an unsorted array of integers  `nums`, return  _the length of the longest  **continuous increasing subsequence**  (i.e. subarray)_. The subsequence must be  **strictly**  increasing.

A  **continuous increasing subsequence**  is defined by two indices  `l`  and  `r`  (`l < r`) such that it is  `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]`  and for each  `l <= i < r`,  `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
-   `-109  <= nums[i] <= 109`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start = 1
        result = 1
        nums_len = len(nums)
        i = 0
        while  nums_len > i + 1:
            if nums[i + 1] > nums[i]:
                start += 1
            else:
                if start > result:
                    result = start
                start = 1
            i += 1
        return (result, start)[start > result]
            
```
