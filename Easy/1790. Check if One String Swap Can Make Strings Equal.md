You are given two strings  `s1`  and  `s2`  of equal length. A  **string swap**  is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return  `true`  _if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing  **at most one string swap** on  **exactly one**  of the strings._ Otherwise, return  `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
-   `s1.length == s2.length`
-   `s1`  and  `s2`  consist of only lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):
            return False
        result = 0
        for x, y in zip(s1, s2):
            if x != y:
                result += 1
            if result > 2:
                return False
        return True
```

```python
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        result = []
        count = 0
        for x, y in zip(s1, s2):
            if x != y:
                result.append((x, y))
                count += 1
            if count > 2:
                return False
        if count == 0:
            return True
        elif count == 2:
            return result[0] == result[1][::-1]
        return False
