Given two strings  `s`  and  `t`, return  `true` _if_ `s` _is a  **subsequence**  of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A  **subsequence**  of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e.,  `"ace"`  is a subsequence of  `"abcde"`  while  `"aec"`  is not).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
-   `0 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= t.length <= 104`
-   `s`  and  `t`  consist only of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return True
        i, n = 0, len(s)
        for char in t:
            if char == s[i]:
                i += 1
            if i == n:
                return True
        return False
```
