Given two positive integers  `a`  and  `b`, return  _the number of  **common**  factors of_ `a` _and_ `b`.

An integer  `x`  is a  **common factor**  of  `a`  and  `b`  if  `x`  divides both  `a`  and  `b`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= a, b <= 1000`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hardestWorker(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        result = logs[0]
        for i in range(1, len(logs)):
            time = logs[i][1] - logs[i - 1][1]
            if result[1] < time:
                result = [logs[i][0], time]
            elif result[1] == time and result[0] > logs[i][0]:
                result = [logs[i][0], time]
        return result[0]
```
