You have  `n`  coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of  `k`  rows where the  `ith`  row has exactly  `i`  coins. The last row of the staircase  **may be**  incomplete.

Given the integer  `n`, return  _the number of  **complete rows**  of the staircase you will build_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```


**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= n <= 231  - 1`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        start = 1
        while n > -1:
            n = n - start
            if n >= 0:
                result += 1
            start += 1
        return result
    
```
