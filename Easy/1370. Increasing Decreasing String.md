Given a string  `s`. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:

1.  Pick the  **smallest**  character from  `s`  and  **append**  it to the result.
2.  Pick the  **smallest**  character from  `s`  which is greater than the last appended character to the result and  **append**  it.
3.  Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
4.  Pick the  **largest** character from  `s`  and  **append**  it to the result.
5.  Pick the  **largest** character from  `s`  which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and  **append**  it.
6.  Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
7.  Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from  `s`.

In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.<br>

Return  _the result string_  after sorting  `s` with this algorithm.<br><br>

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: "abccbaabccba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "rat"
Output: "art"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "cdelotee"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "ggggggg"
Output: "ggggggg"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
```
**Example 5:**
```
Input: s = "spo"
Output: "ops"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
```

<br>**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
-   `s`  contains only lower-case English letters.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        set_s = set(s)
        result = ''
        s_dict = {}
        for i in set_s:
            s_dict.update({i: s.count(i)})
        m = max(s_dict.values())
        for i in range(m):
            temp = []
            if i % 2 == 0:
                for key, value in s_dict.items():
                    if s_dict[key] > 0:
                        temp.append(key)
                        s_dict[key] -= 1
                temp.sort()
            else:
                for key, value in s_dict.items():
                    if s_dict[key] > 0:
                        temp.append(key)
                        s_dict[key] -= 1
                temp.sort(reverse=True)
            result += ''.join(temp)
        return result
