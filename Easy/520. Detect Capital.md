```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= word.length <= 100`
-   `word`  consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
**Explanation:** The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].

**Example 2:**
```
Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]

```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == score.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 104`
-   `0 <= score[i] <= 106`
-   All the values in  `score`  are  **unique**.

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        if word.istitle():
            return True
        elif word.islower():
            return True
        return word.isupper()
