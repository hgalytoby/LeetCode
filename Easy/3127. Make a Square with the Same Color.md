You are given a 2D matrix  `grid`  of size  `3 x 3`  consisting only of characters  `'B'`  and  `'W'`. Character  `'W'`  represents the white color, and character  `'B'`  represents the black color.

Your task is to change the color of  **at most one**  cell  so that the matrix has a  `2 x 2`  square where all cells are of the same color.

Return  `true`  if it is possible to create a  `2 x 2`  square of the same color, otherwise, return  `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
**Input:**  grid = [["B","W","B"],["B","W","W"],["B","W","B"]]
**Output:**  true
**Explanation:**
```
It can be done by changing the color of the  `grid[0][2]`.

**Example 2:**
```
**Input:**  grid = [["B","W","B"],["W","B","W"],["B","W","B"]]
**Output:**  false
**Explanation:**
```

It cannot be done by changing at most one cell.

**Example 3:**
```
**Input:**  grid = [["B","W","B"],["B","W","W"],["B","W","W"]]
**Output:**  true
**Explanation:**
```

The  `grid`  already contains a  `2 x 2`  square of the same color.

**Constraints:**

-   `grid.length == 3`
-   `grid[i].length == 3`
-   `grid[i][j]`  is either  `'W'`  or  `'B'`.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def canMakeSquare(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for r in range(m - 1):
            for c in range(n - 1):
                counter = Counter([grid[r][c], grid[r][c + 1], grid[r + 1][c], grid[r + 1][c + 1]])
                if counter['B'] >= 3 or counter['W'] >= 3:
                    return True
        return False
```
