Your friend is typing his  `name`  into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character  `c`, the key might get  _long pressed_, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the  `typed`  characters of the keyboard. Return  `True`  if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000`
-   `name`  and  `typed`  consist of only lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def group(self, arr: list) -> list:
        data = [[arr[0], 1]]
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == data[-1][0]:
                data[-1][1] += 1
            else:
                data.append([arr[i], 1])
        return data
    
    def isLongPressedName(self, name: str, typed: str) -> bool:
        name = self.group(name)
        typed = self.group(typed)
        if len(name) != len(typed):
            return False
        for item1, item2 in zip(name, typed):
            if item1[0] != item2[0] or item1[1] > item2[1]:
                return False
        return True
