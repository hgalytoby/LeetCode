A string  `s`  is  **nice**  if, for every letter of the alphabet that  `s`  contains, it appears  **both**  in
uppercase and lowercase. For example,  `"abABB"`  is nice because  `'A'`  and  `'a'`  appear, and  `'B'`  and  `'b'`
appear. However,  `"abA"`  is not because  `'b'`  appears, but  `'B'`  does not.

Given a string  `s`, return  _the longest  **substring**  of  `s`  that is  **nice**. If there are multiple, return the
substring of the  **earliest**  occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "YazaAay"
Output: "aAa"
Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.
"aAa" is the longest nice substring.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "Bb"
Output: "Bb"
Explanation: "Bb" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "c"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no nice substrings.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s`  consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def longestNiceSubstring(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        arr = []
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                count = {}
                char = s[i:j + 1]
                for k in char:
                    if k.islower() and k.upper() in count:
                        count[k] = True
                        count[k.upper()] = True
                    elif k.isupper() and k.lower() in count:
                        count[k] = True
                        count[k.lower()] = True
                    else:
                        count[k] = False
                if all(v for v in count.values()):
                    arr.append(char)
        max_n = len(max(arr, key=len, default=''))
        return next((item for item in arr if len(item) == max_n), "")
