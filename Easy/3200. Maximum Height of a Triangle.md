You are given two integers  `red`  and  `blue`  representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to
arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd
row will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the  **same**  color, and adjacent rows should have  **different**  colors.

Return the  **maximum** _height of the triangle_  that can be achieved.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  red = 2, blue = 4
Output:  3

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= red, blue <= 100`

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def maxHeightOfTriangle(self, red: int, blue: int) -> int:
        def f(n1, n2):
            result = 0
            count = 0
            while True:
                v = result % 2
                count += 1
                if v % 2 == 0:
                    if n1 < count:
                        break
                    n1 -= count
                else:
                    if n2 < count:
                        break
                    n2 -= count
                result += 1
            return result

        return max(f(red, blue), f(blue, red))
