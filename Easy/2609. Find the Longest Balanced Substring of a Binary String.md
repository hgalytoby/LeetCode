You are given a binary string  `s`  consisting only of zeroes and ones.

A substring of  `s`  is considered balanced if **all zeroes are before ones**  and the number of zeroes is equal to the
number of ones inside the substring. Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.

Return  _the length of the longest balanced substring of_ `s`.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "01000111"
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "000111", which has length 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "00111"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "0011", which has length 4. 
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "111"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no balanced substring except the empty substring, so the answer is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 50`
- `'0' <= s[i] <= '1'`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheLongestBalancedSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        temp = ''
        while len(temp) < len(s):
            temp = f'0{temp}1'
            if temp not in s:
                return len(temp) - 2
        return len(temp)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheLongestBalancedSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        arr = [[s[0], 1]]
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if arr[-1][0] != s[i]:
                arr.append([s[i], 1])
            else:
                arr[-1][1] += 1
        result = 0
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i][0] == '1':
                result = max(result, min(arr[i - 1][1], arr[i][1]) * 2)
        return result
```
