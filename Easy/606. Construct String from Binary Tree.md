Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with
the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the
original binary tree.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

### Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def tree2str(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        if not root:
            return ''
        left = self.tree2str(root.left)
        right = self.tree2str(root.right)
        if not left and not right:
            return str(root.val)
        if not right:
            return f'{root.val}({left})'
        return f'{root.val}({left})({right})'
```
