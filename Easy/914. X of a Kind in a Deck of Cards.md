In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return  `true`  if and only if you can choose  `X >= 2`  such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

-   Each group has exactly  `X`  cards.
-   All the cards in each group have the same integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= deck.length <= 104`
-   `0 <= deck[i] < 104`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:
        data = {}
        for num in deck:
            if num not in data:
                data[num] = 1
            else:
                data[num] += 1
        min_value = min(data.values())
        data_len = len(data)
        for i in range(2, min_value + 1):
            result = 0
            for k, v in data.items():
                if v % i != 0:
                    break
                result += 1
            if result == data_len:
                return True
        return False
