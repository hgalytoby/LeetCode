Given a fixed-length integer array  `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note**  that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
-   `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """
        arr_len = len(arr)
        i = 0
        while arr_len > i:
            if arr[i] == 0:
                arr.insert(i, 0)
                arr.pop()
                i += 1
            i += 1
```
