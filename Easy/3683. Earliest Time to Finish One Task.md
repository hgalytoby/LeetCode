You are given a 2D integer array  `tasks`  where  `tasks[i] = [si, ti]`.

Each  `[si, ti]`  in  `tasks`  represents a task with start time  `si`  that takes  `ti`  units of time to finish.

Return the earliest time at which at least one task is finished.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  tasks = [[1,6],[2,3]]
Output:  5
Explanation:
The first task starts at time  `t = 1`  and finishes at time  `1 + 6 = 7`. The second task finishes at time  `2 + 3 = 5`. You can finish one task at time 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  tasks = [[100,100],[100,100],[100,100]]
Output:  200
Explanation:
All three tasks finish at time  `100 + 100 = 200`.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= tasks.length <= 100`
-   `tasks[i] = [si, ti]`
-   `1 <= si, ti <= 100`


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def earliestTime(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        result = 200
        for s, e in tasks:
            result = min(result, s + e)
        return result
```
