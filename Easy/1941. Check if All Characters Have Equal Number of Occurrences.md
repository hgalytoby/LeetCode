Given a string  `s`, return  `true` _if_ `s` _is a  **good**  string, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A string  `s`  is  **good**  if  **all**  the characters that appear in  `s`  have the  **same**  number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
-   `s`  consists of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def areOccurrencesEqual(self, s: str) -> bool:
        data = {}
        for char in s:
            data[char] = data.get(char, 0) + 1
        return len(set(data.values())) == 1
```
