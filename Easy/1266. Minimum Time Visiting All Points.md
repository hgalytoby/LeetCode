On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.<br>

You can move according to the next rules:<br>
* In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).<br>

* You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.<br><br>

 

**Example 1**:<br>

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
```
**Example 2**:<br>
```
Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
```
**Constraints**:<br>
* `points.length == n`<br>
* `1 <= n <= 100`<br>
* `points[i].length == 2`<br>
* `-1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000`<br>


### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return sum(
            max(abs(points[i][0] - points[i + 1][0]), abs(points[i][1] - points[i + 1][1]))
            for i in range(len(points) - 1)
        )
```
