You are given a  `n x n`  2D array  `grid`  containing  **distinct**  elements in the range  `[0, n2 - 1]`.

Implement the  `NeighborSum`  class:

- `NeighborSum(int [][]grid)`  initializes the object.
- `int adjacentSum(int value)`  returns the  **sum**  of elements which are adjacent neighbors of  `value`, that is
  either to the top, left, right, or bottom of  `value`  in  `grid`.
- `int diagonalSum(int value)`  returns the  **sum**  of elements which are diagonal neighbors of  `value`, that is
  either to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right of  `value`  in  `grid`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:**
["NeighborSum", "adjacentSum", "adjacentSum", "diagonalSum", "diagonalSum"]
[[[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]], [1], [4], [4], [8]]
**Output:**  [null, 6, 16, 16, 4]
**Explanation:**
```

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/24/designexample0.png)**

- The adjacent neighbors of 1 are 0, 2, and 4.
- The adjacent neighbors of 4 are 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- The diagonal neighbors of 4 are 0, 2, 6, and 8.
- The diagonal neighbor of 8 is 4.

```
**Example 2:**
**Input:**
["NeighborSum", "adjacentSum", "diagonalSum"]
[[[[1, 2, 0, 3], [4, 7, 15, 6], [8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 5]]], [15], [9]]
**Output:**  [null, 23, 45]
```

**Explanation:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/24/designexample2.png)**

- The adjacent neighbors of 15 are 0, 10, 7, and 6.
- The diagonal neighbors of 9 are 4, 12, 14, and 15.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n == grid.length == grid[0].length <= 10`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= n2 - 1`
- All  `grid[i][j]`  are distinct.
- `value`  in  `adjacentSum`  and  `diagonalSum`  will be in the range  `[0, n2 - 1]`.
- At most  `2 * n2`  calls will be made to  `adjacentSum`  and  `diagonalSum`.

### Python

```py
class NeighborSum:

    def __init__(self, grid: List[List[int]]):
        self.adjacent_map = {}
        self.diagonal_map = {}
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                v1 = v2 = 0
                if i - 1 >= 0:
                    if j - 1 >= 0:
                        v2 += grid[i - 1][j - 1]
                    if n > j + 1:
                        v2 += grid[i - 1][j + 1]

                    v1 += grid[i - 1][j]
                if n > i + 1:
                    if j - 1 >= 0:
                        v2 += grid[i + 1][j - 1]
                    if n > j + 1:
                        v2 += grid[i + 1][j + 1]
                    v1 += grid[i + 1][j]
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    v1 += grid[i][j - 1]
                if n > j + 1:
                    v1 += grid[i][j + 1]

                self.adjacent_map[grid[i][j]] = v1
                self.diagonal_map[grid[i][j]] = v2

    def adjacentSum(self, value: int) -> int:
        return self.adjacent_map[value]

    def diagonalSum(self, value: int) -> int:
        return self.diagonal_map[value]

# Your NeighborSum object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = NeighborSum(grid)
# param_1 = obj.adjacentSum(value)
# param_2 = obj.diagonalSum(value)
