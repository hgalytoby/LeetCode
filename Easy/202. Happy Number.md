Write an algorithm to determine if a number  `n`  is happy.

A  **happy number**  is a number defined by the following process:

-   Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
-   Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it  **loops endlessly in a cycle**  which does not include 1.
-   Those numbers for which this process  **ends in 1**  are happy.

Return  `true`  _if_  `n`  _is a happy number, and_  `false`  _if not_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= n <= 231  - 1`

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        n, _ = str(n), 0
        while _ != 1 and _ != 4:
            _ = 0
            for i in n:
                _ += int(i) ** 2
            n = str(_)
        if _ == 1:
            return True
        return False
```
