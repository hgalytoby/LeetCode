Given a string  `path`, where  `path[i] = 'N'`,  `'S'`,  `'E'`  or  `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin  `(0, 0)`  on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by  `path`.

Return  `true`  _if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited_. Return  `false`  otherwise.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123929-pm.png)
```
Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123843-pm.png)
```
Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= path.length <= 104`
-   `path[i]`  is either  `'N'`,  `'S'`,  `'E'`, or  `'W'`.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isPathCrossing(self, path: str) -> bool:
        start = [0, 0]
        record = {(0, 0)}
        move = {'N':[0, 1], 'S':[0, -1], 'W':[1, 0], 'E':[-1, 0]}
        for char in path:
            start = (move[char][0] + start[0], move[char][1] + start[1])
            if start in record:
                return True
            record.add(start)
        return False
```

        move = {'N': [0, 1], 'S': [0, -1], 'W': [1, 0], 'E': [-1, 0]}
        for char in path:
            start = tuple(map(lambda x: x[0] + x[1], zip(start, move[char])))
            if start in record:
                return True
            record.add(start)
        return False
