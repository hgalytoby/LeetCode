Given two non-negative integers  `low`  and  `high`. Return the  _count of odd numbers between_ `low` _and_ `high` _(inclusive)_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= low <= high <= 10^9`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        return len(range((low, low + 1)[low % 2 == 0], (high + 1, high)[high % 2 == 0], 2))
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        result = (high - low) // 2
        return (result + 1, result)[low % 2 == 0 and high % 2 == 0]
```
