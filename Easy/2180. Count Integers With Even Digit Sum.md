Given a positive integer  `num`, return  _the number of positive integers  **less than or equal to**_  `num`  _whose digit sums are  **even**_.

The  **digit sum**  of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 30
Output: 14
Explanation:
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 1000`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countEven(self, num: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        for n in range(1, num + 1):
            result += sum(map(int, str(n))) % 2 == 0
        return result
```
