The  **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted  `F(n)`  form a sequence, called the  **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from  `0`  and  `1`. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

Given  `n`, calculate  `F(n)`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= n <= 30`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        n1 = 0
        n2 = 1
        count = 0
        while n > count:
            n1, n2 = n2, n1 + n2
            count += 1
        return n1
```
