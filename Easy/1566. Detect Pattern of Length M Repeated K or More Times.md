Given an array of positive integers  `arr`, find a pattern of length  `m`  that is repeated  `k`  or more times.

A  **pattern**  is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times  **consecutively** without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

Return  `true`  _if there exists a pattern of length_  `m`  _that is repeated_  `k`  _or more times, otherwise return_  `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern **(4)** of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern **(1,2)** of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. Another valid pattern **(2,1) is** also repeated 2 times.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= arr.length <= 100`
-   `1 <= arr[i] <= 100`
-   `1 <= m <= 100`
-   `2 <= k <= 100`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def containsPattern(self, arr: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(arr) - m * k + 1):
            pattern = arr[i:i + m]
            for j in range(k - 1):
                if arr[i + m * (j + 1):i + m * (j + 2)] != pattern:
                    break
                if j == k - 2:
                    return True
        return False
```
