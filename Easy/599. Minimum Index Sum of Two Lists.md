Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their  **common interest**  with the  **least list index sum**. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation:** The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:** list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output:** ["Shogun"]
Explanation:** The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000`
-   `1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30`
-   `list1[i]`  and  `list2[i]`  consist of spaces  `' '`  and English letters.
-   All the stings of  `list1`  are  **unique**.
-   All the stings of  `list2` are  **unique**.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        data = {}
        for index, char in enumerate(list1):
            if char in list2:
                _ = index + list2.index(char)
                if _ in data:
                    data[_].append(char)
                else:
                    data[_] = [char]
        return data[min(data.keys())]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        n, m = ((list1, list2), (list2, list1))[len(list1) > len(list2)]
        data = {}
        for i, v in enumerate(n):
            if v in m:
                data[v] = i + m.index(v)
        key = min(data, key=data.get)
        return list(filter(lambda x: data[x] == data[key], data.keys()))
```
