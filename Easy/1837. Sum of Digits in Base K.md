Given an integer  `n`  (in base  `10`) and a base  `k`, return  _the  **sum**  of the digits of_ `n` _**after**  converting_ `n` _from base_ `10` _to base_ `k`.

After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base  `10`  number, and the sum should be returned in base  `10`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 34, k = 6
Output: 9
Explanation: 34 (base 10) expressed in base 6 is 54. 5 + 4 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 10, k = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: n is already in base 10. 1 + 0 = 1.
```


**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 100`
-   `2 <= k <= 10`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def sumBase(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        while n > 0:
            x, y = divmod(n, k)
            result +=y 
            n = x
        return result
```
