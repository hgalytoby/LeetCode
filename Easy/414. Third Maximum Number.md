Given an integer array  `nums`, return  _the  **third distinct maximum**  number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the  **maximum**  number_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
-   `-231  <= nums[i] <= 231  - 1`

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        data = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num not in data:
                data[num] = 1
        result = list(data.keys())
        result.sort()
        if len(result) >= 3:
            return result[-3]
        return result[-1]
```
