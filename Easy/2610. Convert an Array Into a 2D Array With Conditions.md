You are given an integer array  `nums`. You need to create a 2D array from  `nums`  satisfying the following conditions:

-   The 2D array should contain  **only**  the elements of the array  `nums`.
-   Each row in the 2D array contains  **distinct**  integers.
-   The number of rows in the 2D array should be  **minimal**.

Return  _the resulting array_. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Note**  that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
-   `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        counter = Counter(nums)
        result = [[] for _ in range(max(counter.values()))]
        for k, v in counter.items():
            for i in range(v):
                result[i].append(k)
        return result
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        counter = Counter(nums)
        n = max(counter.values())
        result = []
        for _ in range(n):
            arr = []
            for k, v in counter.items():
                if v <= 0:
                    continue
                counter[k] -= 1
                arr.append(k)
            result.append(arr)
        return result
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        counter = Counter(nums)
        n = len(nums)
        result = []
        while n > 0:
            temp = []
            items = counter.items()
            for k, v in items:
                if v <= 0:
                    continue
                n -= 1
                counter[k] -= 1
                temp.append(k)
            result.append(temp)
        return result
```
