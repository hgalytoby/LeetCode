Given the roots of two binary trees  `p`  and  `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range  `[0, 100]`.
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104

### Python
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if not p or not q:
            return False
        return p and q and p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```
