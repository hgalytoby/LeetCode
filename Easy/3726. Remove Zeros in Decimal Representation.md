You are given a  **positive**  integer  `n`.

Return the integer obtained by removing all zeros from the decimal representation of  `n`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  n = 1020030
Output:  123
Explanation:
After removing all zeros from 1**0**2**00**3**0**, we get 123.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  n = 1
Output:  1
Explanation:
1 has no zero in its decimal representation. Therefore, the answer is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 1015`


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def removeZeros(self, n: int) -> int:
        return int(str(n).replace("0", ""))
```
