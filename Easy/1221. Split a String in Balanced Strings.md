Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.<br>

Given a balanced string `s` split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.<br>

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.<br><br>

 

**Example 1**:<br>
```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```
**Example 2**:<br>
```
Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```
**Example 3**:<br>
```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```
**Example 4**:<br>
```
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains an equal number of 'L' and 'R'
```
**Constraints**:<br>
* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`<br>
* `s[i] = 'L' or 'R'`<br>

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def balancedStringSplit(self, s: str) -> int:
        count, result = 0, 0
        for i in s:
            if i == 'R':
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
            if count == 0:
                result += 1
        return result
```
