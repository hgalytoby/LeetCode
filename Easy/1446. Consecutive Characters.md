The  **power**  of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string  `s`, return  _the  **power**  of_  `s`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
-   `s`  consists of only lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        start = s[0]
        result = count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if start == s[i]:
                count += 1
                if count > result:
                    result = count
            else:
                count = 1
                start = s[i]
        return result
```
