You are given two strings  `word1`  and  `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with  `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return  _the merged string._

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
-   `word1`  and  `word2`  consist of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x + y[0] + y[1], itertools.zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue=''), '')
```

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        return ''.join(x + y for x, y in itertools.zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue=''))
```

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        result = ''
        i = 0
        while i < len(word1) and i < len(word2):
            result += word1[i] + word2[i]
            i += 1
        return result + word1[i:] + word2[i:]
```
