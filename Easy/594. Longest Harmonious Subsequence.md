We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is  *
*exactly**  `1`.

Given an integer array  `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible
subsequences.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output:  5
Explanation:
The longest harmonious subsequence is  `[3,2,2,2,3]`.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output:  2
Explanation:
The longest harmonious subsequences are  `[1,2]`,  `[2,3]`, and  `[3,4]`, all of which have a length of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:  nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output:  0
Explanation:
No harmonic subsequence exists.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = Counter(nums)
        result = 0
        for n in counter:
            max_v = max(counter[n - 1], counter[n + 1])
            if max_v > 0:
                result = max(result, counter[n] + max_v)
        return result
```
