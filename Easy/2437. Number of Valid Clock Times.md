You are given a string of length  `5`  called  `time`, representing the current time on a digital clock in the
format  `"hh:mm"`. The  **earliest**  possible time is  `"00:00"`  and the  **latest**  possible time is  `"23:59"`.

In the string  `time`, the digits represented by the  `?` symbol are  **unknown**, and must be  **replaced**  with a
digit from  `0`  to  `9`.

Return _an integer_ `answer`_, the number of valid clock times that can be created by replacing every_ `?` _with a digit
from_ `0` _to_ `9`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: time = "?5:00"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the ? with either a 0 or 1, producing "05:00" or "15:00". Note that we cannot replace it with a 2, since the time "25:00" is invalid. In total, we have two choices.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: time = "0?:0?"
Output: 100
Explanation: Each ? can be replaced by any digit from 0 to 9, so we have 100 total choices.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: time = "??:??"
Output: 1440
Explanation: There are 24 possible choices for the hours, and 60 possible choices for the minutes. In total, we have 24 * 60 = 1440 choices.
```

**Constraints:**

- `time`  is a valid string of length  `5`  in the format  `"hh:mm"`.
- `"00" <= hh <= "23"`
- `"00" <= mm <= "59"`
- Some of the digits might be replaced with  `'?'`  and need to be replaced with digits from  `0`  to  `9`.

        m1 = m2 = 1
        if time[-1] == '?':
            m2 = 10
        if time[-2] == '?':
            m1 = 6
        m = m1 * m2
        if time[1] == '?' and time[0] == '?':
