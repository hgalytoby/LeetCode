**No-Zero integer**  is a positive integer that  **does not contain any  `0`**  in its decimal representation.

Given an integer  `n`, return  _a list of two integers_  `[A, B]`  _where_:

-   `A`  and  `B`  are  **No-Zero integers**.
-   `A + B = n`

The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B do not contain any 0 in their decimal representation.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 104`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getNoZeroIntegers(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        i = 1
        while n > i:
            _ = n - i
            if all('0' not in num for num in  [str(_), str(i)]):
                return [i, _]
            i += 1
```
