Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly  `duration`  seconds. More formally, an attack at second  `t`  will mean Ashe is poisoned during the  **inclusive**  time interval  `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again  **before**  the poison effect ends, the timer for it is  **reset**, and the poison effect will end  `duration`  seconds after the new attack.

You are given a  **non-decreasing**  integer array  `timeSeries`, where  `timeSeries[i]`  denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second  `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer  `duration`.

Return  _the  **total**  number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= timeSeries.length <= 104`
-   `0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 107`
-   `timeSeries`  is sorted in  **non-decreasing**  order.

    def findPoisonedDuration(self, timeSeries: List[int], duration: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(timeSeries) - 1):
            _ = timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i]
            if _ >= duration:
                result += duration
            else:
                result += _
        return result + duration
```

        for index, num in enumerate(timeSeries[1:]):
            _ = num - timeSeries[index]
            if _ >= duration:
                result += duration
            else:
                result += _
        return result + duration
