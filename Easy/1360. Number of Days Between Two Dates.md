Write a program to count the number of days between two dates.

The two dates are given as strings, their format is  `YYYY-MM-DD` as shown in the examples.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: date1 = "2019-06-29", date2 = "2019-06-30"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: date1 = "2020-01-15", date2 = "2019-12-31"
Output: 15
```

**Constraints:**

-   The given dates are valid dates between the years  `1971`  and  `2100`.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def daysBetweenDates(self, date1: str, date2: str) -> int:
        return abs((datetime.datetime(*map(int, date1.split('-'))) - datetime.datetime(*map(int, date2.split('-')))).days)
```
