Given an array of string  `words`. Return all strings in  `words`  which is substring of another word in  **any**  order.

String  `words[i]`  is substring of  `words[j]`, if can be obtained removing some characters to left and/or right side of  `words[j]`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
-   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
-   `words[i]`  contains only lowercase English letters.
-   It's  **guaranteed** that  `words[i]` will be unique.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def stringMatching(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        for word in words:
            for w in words:
                if w != word and word in w:
                    result.append(word)
                    break
        return result
```

```python
class Solution:
    def stringMatching(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        n = len(words)
        words.sort(key=len)
        result = []
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if words[i] in words[j]:
                    result.append(words[i])
                    break
        return result
```
