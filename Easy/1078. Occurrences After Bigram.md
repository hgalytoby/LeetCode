Given two strings  `first`  and  `second`, consider occurrences in some text of the form  `"first second third"`, where  `second`  comes immediately after  `first`, and  `third`  comes immediately after  `second`.

Return  _an array of all the words_  `third`  _for each occurrence of_  `"first second third"`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= text.length <= 1000`
-   `text`  consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
-   All the words in  `text`  a separated by  **a single space**.
-   `1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10`
-   `first`  and  `second`  consist of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findOcurrences(self, text: str, first: str, second: str) -> List[str]:
        text_split = text.split()
        result = []
        for i in range(len(text_split) - 2):
            if text_split[i] == first and text_split[i + 1] == second:
                result.append(text_split[i + 2])
        return result
```
