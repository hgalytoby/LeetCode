### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def dayOfYear(self, date: str) -> int:
        mdays = [0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
        y, m, d = map(int, date.split('-'))
        if y % 4 == 0 and y % 100 != 0 or y % 400 == 0:
            mdays[2] = 29
        result = 0
        for i in range(m):
            result += mdays[i]
        return result + d
```
