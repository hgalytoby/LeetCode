You are given a  **positive**  integer  `n`.

Let  `s`  be the  **binary representation**  of  `n`  without leading zeros.

The  **reverse**  of a binary string  `s`  is obtained by writing the characters of  `s`  in the opposite order.

You may flip any bit in  `s`  (change  `0 → 1`  or  `1 → 0`). Each flip affects  **exactly**  one bit.

Return the  **minimum**  number of flips required to make  `s`  equal to the reverse of its original form.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  n = 7
Output:  0
Explanation:
The binary representation of 7 is  `"111"`. Its reverse is also  `"111"`, which is the same. Hence, no flips are needed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  n = 10
Output:  4
Explanation:
The binary representation of 10 is  `"1010"`. Its reverse is  `"0101"`. All four bits must be flipped to make them equal. Thus, the minimum number of flips required is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 109`


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def minimumFlips(self, n: int) -> int:
        val = bin(n)[2:]
        flip = val[::-1]
        return sum(a != b for a, b in zip(val, flip))
```
