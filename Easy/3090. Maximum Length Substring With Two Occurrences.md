Given a string `s`, return the **maximum** length of a

substring

such that it contains _at most two occurrences_ of each character.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  s = "bcbbbcba"

Output:  4

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character:  `"bcbbbcba"`.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  s = "aaaa"

Output:  2

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character:  `"aaaa"`.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `s`  consists only of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumLengthSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        l = result = 0
        counter = Counter()
        for r, char in enumerate(s):
            counter[char] += 1
            while counter[char] > 2:
                counter[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            result = max(result, r + 1 - l)
        return result
```
