You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in  **adjacent**  plots.

Given an integer array  `flowerbed`  containing  `0`'s and  `1`'s, where  `0`  means empty and  `1`  means not empty, and an integer  `n`, return  _if_  `n`  new flowers can be planted in the  `flowerbed`  without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
-   `flowerbed[i]`  is  `0`  or  `1`.
-   There are no two adjacent flowers in  `flowerbed`.
-   `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        length = len(flowerbed)
        count = 0
        for i in range(length):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                if i + 1 == length:
                    if flowerbed[i - 1] == 0:
                        count += 1
                elif i == 0:
                    if flowerbed[i + 1] == 0:
                        count += 1
                        flowerbed[i] = 1
                elif flowerbed[i + 1] + flowerbed[i - 1] == 0:
                    count += 1
                    flowerbed[i] = 1
                if count >= n:
                    return True
        return count >= n
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        length = len(flowerbed)
        count = 0
        for i in range(length):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                l = i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0
                r = i + 1 == length or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0
                if l and r:
                    flowerbed[i] = 1
                    count += 1
                    if count >= n:
                        return True
        return count >= n
