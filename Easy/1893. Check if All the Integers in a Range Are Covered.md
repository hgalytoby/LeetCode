You are given a 2D integer array  `ranges`  and two integers  `left`  and  `right`. Each  `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]`  represents an  **inclusive**  interval between  `starti`  and  `endi`.

Return  `true`  _if each integer in the inclusive range_  `[left, right]`  _is covered by  **at least one**  interval in_  `ranges`. Return  `false`  _otherwise_.

An integer  `x`  is covered by an interval  `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]`  if  `starti  <= x <= endi`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
- 2 is covered by the first range.
- 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
- 5 is covered by the third range.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 is not covered by any range.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= ranges.length <= 50`
-   `1 <= starti  <= endi  <= 50`
-   `1 <= left <= right <= 50`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isCovered(self, ranges: List[List[int]], left: int, right: int) -> bool:
        ranges_set = set()
        for x, y in ranges:
            ranges_set.update(list(range(x, y + 1)))
        return not set(range(left, right + 1)).difference(ranges_set)
```
