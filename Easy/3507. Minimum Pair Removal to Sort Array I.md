Given an array  `nums`, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

-   Select the  **adjacent**  pair with the  **minimum**  sum in  `nums`. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
-   Replace the pair with their sum.

Return the  **minimum number of operations**  needed to make the array  **non-decreasing**.

An array is said to be  **non-decreasing**  if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output:  2
Explanation:
-   The pair  `(3,1)`  has the minimum sum of 4. After replacement,  `nums = [5,2,4]`.
-   The pair  `(2,4)`  has the minimum sum of 6. After replacement,  `nums = [5,6]`.
The array  `nums`  became non-decreasing in two operations.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  nums = [1,2,2]
Output:  0
Explanation:
The array  `nums`  is already sorted.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
-   `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`


### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumPairRemoval(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        while nums and sorted(nums) != nums:
            min_v = math.inf
            index = 0
            for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
                v = nums[i] + nums[i + 1]
                if min_v > v:
                    min_v = v
                    index = i
            nums = nums[:index] + [min_v] + nums[index + 2:]
            count += 1
        return count
                
```
