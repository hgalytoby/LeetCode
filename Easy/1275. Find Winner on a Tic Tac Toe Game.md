**Tic-tac-toe**  is played by two players  `A`  and  `B`  on a  `3 x 3`  grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

-   Players take turns placing characters into empty squares  `' '`.
-   The first player  `A`  always places  `'X'`  characters, while the second player  `B`  always places  `'O'`  characters.
-   `'X'`  and  `'O'`  characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
-   The game ends when there are  **three**  of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
-   The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
-   No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array  `moves`  where  `moves[i] = [rowi, coli]`  indicates that the  `ith`  move will be played on  `grid[rowi][coli]`. return  _the winner of the game if it exists_  (`A`  or  `B`). In case the game ends in a draw return  `"Draw"`. If there are still movements to play return  `"Pending"`.

You can assume that  `moves`  is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of  **Tic-Tac-Toe**), the grid is initially empty, and  `A`  will play first.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: A wins, they always play first.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: B wins.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo3-grid.jpg)
```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
-   `moves[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= rowi, coli  <= 2`
-   There are no repeated elements on  `moves`.
-   `moves`  follow the rules of tic tac toe.

                after.append([i, j])
                before.append([j, i])
            result += [after] + [before]
        after, before = [], []
        for i in range(3):
            after.append([i, i])
            before.append([2 - i, i])
        return result + [after] + [before]
