Given the  `root`  of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return  _all the  [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics))  (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it_.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in  **any order**.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

-   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys  **less than or equal to**  the node's key.
-   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys  **greater than or equal to**  the node's key.
-   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/11/mode-tree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
Output: [2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 104]`.
-   `-105  <= Node.val <= 105`

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).


### Python
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findMode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = defaultdict(int)
        def dfs(node, arr):
            if node:
                arr[node.val] += 1
                dfs(node.left, arr)
                dfs(node.right, arr)
        
        dfs(root, result)
        max_value = max(result.values())
        return [k for k, v in result.items() if v == max_value]
```
