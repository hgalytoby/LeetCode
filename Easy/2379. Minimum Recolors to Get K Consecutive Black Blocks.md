You are given a  **0-indexed**  string  `blocks`  of length  `n`, where  `blocks[i]`  is either  `'W'`  or  `'B'`, representing the color of the  `ith`  block. The characters  `'W'`  and  `'B'`  denote the colors white and black, respectively.

You are also given an integer  `k`, which is the desired number of  **consecutive**  black blocks.

In one operation, you can  **recolor**  a white block such that it becomes a black block.

Return _the  **minimum**  number of operations needed such that there is at least  **one**  occurrence of_ `k` _consecutive black blocks._

**Example 1:**
```
Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
Output: 3
Explanation:
One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
Therefore, we return 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
Therefore, we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == blocks.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 100`
-   `blocks[i]`  is either  `'W'`  or  `'B'`.
-   `1 <= k <= n`

            if blocks[i] == 'B':
                value -= 1
            if blocks[i + k] == 'B':
                value += 1
            if value == k:
                return 0
            result = max(result, value)
        return k - result

            if i + 1 >= k:
                if i - k >= 0 and blocks[i - k] == "W":
                    count -= 1
                result = min(result, count)
