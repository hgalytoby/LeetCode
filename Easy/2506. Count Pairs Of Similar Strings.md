You are given a  **0-indexed**  string array  `words`.

Two strings are  **similar**  if they consist of the same characters.

- For example,  `"abca"`  and  `"cba"`  are similar since both consist of characters  `'a'`,  `'b'`, and  `'c'`.
- However,  `"abacba"`  and  `"bcfd"`  are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.

Return  _the number of pairs_ `(i, j)` _such that_ `0 <= i < j <= word.length - 1` _and the two strings_ `words[i]`
_and_ `words[j]` _are similar_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["aba","aabb","abcd","bac","aabc"]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
- i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'. 
- i = 3 and j = 4 : both words[3] and words[4] only consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["aabb","ab","ba"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
- i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'. 
- i = 0 and j = 2 : both words[0] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.
- i = 1 and j = 2 : both words[1] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["nba","cba","dba"]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there does not exist any pair that satisfies the conditions, we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]`  consist of only lowercase English letters.
