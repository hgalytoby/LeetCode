You are given a string  `s`. Simulate events at each second  `i`:

-   If  `s[i] == 'E'`, a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
-   If  `s[i] == 'L'`, a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.

Return the  **minimum** number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person who enters the waiting room given that it is initially  **empty**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  s = "EEEEEEE"
Output:  7
Explanation:
```
After each second, a person enters the waiting room and no person leaves it. Therefore, a minimum of 7 chairs is needed.

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  s = "ELELEEL"
Output:  2
Explanation:
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input:  s = "ELEELEELLL"
Output:  3
Explanation:
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 50`
-   `s`  consists only of the letters  `'E'`  and  `'L'`.
-   `s`  represents a valid sequence of entries and exits.


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def minimumChairs(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = chairs = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == 'E':
                chairs += 1
                result = max(result, chairs)
            else:
                chairs -= 1
        return result
```
