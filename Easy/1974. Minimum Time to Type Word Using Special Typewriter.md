There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters  `'a'`  to  `'z'`  arranged in a  **circle**  with a  **pointer**. A character can  **only**  be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is  **initially**  pointing to the character  `'a'`.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/31/chart.jpg)

Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

-   Move the pointer one character  **counterclockwise**  or  **clockwise**.
-   Type the character the pointer is  **currently**  on.

Given a string  `word`, return the **minimum**  number of seconds to type out the characters in  `word`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word = "abc"
Output: 5
Explanation: The characters are printed as follows:
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word = "bza"
Output: 7
Explanation: The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word = "zjpc"
Output: 34
Explanation:
The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
- Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
- Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= word.length <= 100`
-   `word`  consists of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToType(self, word: str) -> int:
        s = string.ascii_lowercase * 3
        now_index = 26
        result = 0
        for char in word:
            left = s.find(char, now_index)
            right = s.rfind(char, 0, now_index)
            result += min(abs(now_index - left), abs(now_index - right)) + 1
            now_index = (right, left)[52 > left > 25]
        return result
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToType(self, word: str) -> int:
        index = 'a'
        result = 0
        for char in word:
            _ = abs(ord(char) - ord(index))
            result += min(_, 26 - _) + 1
            index = char
        return result
```


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToType(self, word: str) -> int:
        ans = len(word)
        prev = "a"
        for ch in word: 
            val = (ord(ch) - ord(prev)) % 26 
            ans += min(val, 26 - val)
            prev = ch
        return ans
