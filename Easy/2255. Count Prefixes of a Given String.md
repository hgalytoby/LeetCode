You are given a string array  `words`  and a string  `s`, where  `words[i]`  and  `s`  comprise only of  **lowercase English letters**.

Return  _the  **number of strings**  in_  `words`  _that are a  **prefix**  of_  `s`.

A  **prefix**  of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
"a", "ab", and "abc".
Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["a","a"], s = "aa"
Output: 2
Explanation: Both of the strings are a prefix of s. 
Note that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it should be counted each time.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length, s.length <= 10`
- `words[i]`  and  `s`  consist of lowercase English letters  **only**.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countPrefixes(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> int:
        data = {s[0:i + 1] for i in range(len(s))}
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x + (y in data), words, 0)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countPrefixes(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> int:
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x + (s[:len(y)] == y), words, 0)
```
