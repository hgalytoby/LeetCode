You are given two strings  `s`  and  `t`  such that every character occurs at most once in  `s`  and  `t`  is a permutation of  `s`.

The  **permutation difference**  between  `s`  and  `t`  is defined as the  **sum**  of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in  `s`  and the index of the occurrence of the same character in  `t`.

Return the  **permutation difference**  between  `s`  and  `t`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  s = "abc", t = "bac"
Output:  2
Explanation:

For  `s = "abc"`  and  `t = "bac"`, the permutation difference of  `s`  and  `t`  is equal to the sum of:

-   The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of  `"a"`  in  `s`  and the index of the occurrence of  `"a"`  in  `t`.
-   The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of  `"b"`  in  `s`  and the index of the occurrence of  `"b"`  in  `t`.
-   The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of  `"c"`  in  `s`  and the index of the occurrence of  `"c"`  in  `t`.

That is, the permutation difference between  `s`  and  `t`  is equal to  `|0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2`.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  s = "abcde", t = "edbac"
Output:  12
Explanation:  The permutation difference between  `s`  and  `t`  is equal to  `|0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4 - 0| = 12`.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 26`
-   Each character occurs at most once in  `s`.
-   `t`  is a permutation of  `s`.
-   `s`  consists only of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def findPermutationDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        items = defaultdict(list)
        for i, (v1, v2) in enumerate(zip(s, t)):
            items[v1].append(i)
            items[v2].append(i)
        return sum(abs(v1 - v2) for v1, v2 in items.values())
```

```py
class Solution:
    def findPermutationDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        items = [[] for _ in range(26)]
        for i, (v1, v2) in enumerate(zip(s, t)):
            items[ord(v1) - 97].append(i)
            items[ord(v2) - 97].append(i)
        return sum(abs(item[0] - item[1]) for item in items if item)
