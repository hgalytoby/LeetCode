Given a string  `s`  which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return  _the length of the  **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are  **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"`  is not considered a palindrome here.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
-   `s`  consists of lowercase  **and/or**  uppercase English letters only.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        counter = Counter(s)
        result = flag = 0
        for v in counter.values():
            if v % 2 == 0:
                result += v
            else:
                flag = 1
                result += v - 1
        return result + flag
```
