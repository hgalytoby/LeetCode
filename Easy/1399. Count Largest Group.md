You are given an integer  `n`.

Each number from  `1`  to  `n`  is grouped according to the sum of its digits.

Return  _the number of groups that have the largest size_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
There are 4 groups with largest size.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 104`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countLargestGroup(self, n: int) -> int:
        data = {}
        max_value = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            _ = sum([int(j) for j in str(i)])
            if _ not in data:
                data[_] = 1
            else:
                data[_] += 1
                max_value = (max_value, data[_])[data[_] > max_value]
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x + (0, 1)[y == max_value], data.values(), 0)
```
