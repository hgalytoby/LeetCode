Given two strings  `s`  and  `goal`, return  `true` _if you can swap two letters in_ `s` _so the result is equal to_ `goal`_, otherwise, return_ `false`_._

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices  `i`  and  `j`  (0-indexed) such that  `i != j`  and swapping the characters at  `s[i]`  and  `s[j]`.

-   For example, swapping at indices  `0`  and  `2`  in  `"abcd"`  results in  `"cbad"`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104`
-   `s`  and  `goal`  consist of lowercase letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def buddyStrings(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(goal):
            return False
        if s == goal:
            temp = set()
            for char in s:
                if char in temp:
                    return True
                temp.add(char)
            return False
        result = []
        for _s, _goal in zip(s, goal):
            if _s != _goal:
                result.append([_s, _goal])
            if len(result) > 2:
                return False
        return len(result) == 2 and result[0] == result[1][::-1]
