Given a string  `s`, return  _the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters._  If there is no such substring return  `-1`.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two `'a's`.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 300`
-   `s`  contains only lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(self, s: str) -> int:
        data, result = {}, -1
        for index, char in enumerate(s):
            if char not in data:
                data[char] = index
            elif index - 1 - data[char] > result:
                result = index - 1 - data[char]
        return result
```
