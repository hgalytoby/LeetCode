You are given a string  `allowed`  consisting of  **distinct**  characters and an array of strings  `words`. A string is  **consistent** if all characters in the string appear in the string  `allowed`.<br>

Return _the number of  **consistent**  strings in the array_ `words`.<br>

**Example 1:**
```
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= words.length <= 104`
-   `1 <= allowed.length <=  26`
-   `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
-   The characters in  `allowed`  are  **distinct**.
-   `words[i]`  and  `allowed`  contain only lowercase English letters.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        char = set(allowed)
        return sum(not (set(word) - char) for word in words)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        result = len(words)
        for i in words:
            for j in i:
                if j not in allowed:
                    result -= 1
                    break
        return result
```
