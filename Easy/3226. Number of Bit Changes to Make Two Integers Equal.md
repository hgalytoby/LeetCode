You are given two positive integers  `n`  and  `k`.

You can choose  **any**  bit in the  **binary representation**  of  `n`  that is equal to 1 and change it to 0.

Return the  _number of changes_  needed to make  `n`  equal to  `k`. If it is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  n = 13, k = 4
Output:  2
Explanation:  
Initially, the binary representations of  `n`  and  `k`  are  `n = (1101)2`  and  `k = (0100)2`.  
We can change the first and fourth bits of  `n`. The resulting integer is  `n = (**0**10**0**)2 = k`.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  n = 21, k = 21
Output:  0
Explanation:  
`n`  and  `k`  are already equal, so no changes are needed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:  n = 14, k = 13
Output:  -1
Explanation:  
It is not possible to make  `n`  equal to  `k`.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n, k <= 106`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        bin_n = bin(n)[2:]
        bin_k = bin(k)[2:]
        len_diff = len(bin_n) - len(bin_k)
        if len_diff > 0:
            bin_k = '0' * len_diff + bin_k
        elif len_diff < 0:
            bin_n = '0' * -len_diff + bin_n
        result = 0
        for bn, bk in zip(bin_n, bin_k):
            if bk == '1' and bn == '0':
                return -1
            if bn == '1' and bk == '0':
                result += 1
        return result
```
