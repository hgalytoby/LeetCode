Given two strings  `s`  and  `t`, return  `true`  _if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors_.  `'#'`  means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200`
-   `s`  and  `t`  only contain lowercase letters and  `'#'`  characters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x + y if y != '#' else x[:-1], s, '') == reduce(lambda x, y: x + y if y != '#' else x[:-1], t, '')
```
