You are given an array of strings  `words`  and a string  `chars`.

A string is  **good**  if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return  _the sum of lengths of all good strings in words_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
-   `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
-   `words[i]`  and  `chars`  consist of lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        counter, result = Counter(chars), 0
        for word in words:
            visited = set()
            for w in word:
                if w not in visited and counter[w] < word.count(w):
                    break
                visited.add(w)
            else:
                result += len(word)
        return result
```
