There is a snake in an  `n x n`  matrix  `grid`  and can move in  **four possible directions**. Each cell in the  `grid`
is identified by the position:  `grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j`.

The snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer  `n`  representing the size of the  `grid`  and an array of strings  `commands`  where
each  `command[i]`  is either  `"UP"`,  `"RIGHT"`,  `"DOWN"`, and  `"LEFT"`. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain
within the  `grid`  boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing  `commands`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  n = 2, commands = ["RIGHT","DOWN"]
Output:  3
Explanation:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  n = 3, commands = ["DOWN","RIGHT","UP"]
Output:  1
Explanation:
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10`
- `1 <= commands.length <= 100`
- `commands`  consists only of  `"UP"`,  `"RIGHT"`,  `"DOWN"`, and  `"LEFT"`.
- The input is generated such the snake will not move outside of the boundaries.

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def finalPositionOfSnake(self, n: int, commands: List[str]) -> int:
        arr = [[i * n + j for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
        x, y = 0, 0
        command_map = {
            'RIGHT': [0, 1],
            'LEFT': [0, -1],
            'UP': [-1, 0],
            'DOWN': [1, 0],
        }
        result = 0
        for command in commands:
            x += command_map[command][0]
            y += command_map[command][1]
            result = arr[x][y]
        return result
```
