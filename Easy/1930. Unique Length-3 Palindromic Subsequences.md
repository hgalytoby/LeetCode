Given a string  `s`, return  _the number of  **unique palindromes of length three**  that are a  **subsequence**
of_ `s`.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted  **once**.

A  **palindrome**  is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A  **subsequence**  of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none)
deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example,  `"ace"`  is a subsequence of  `"abcde"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s`  consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def countPalindromicSubsequence(self, s: str) -> int:
        result, visited = 0, set()
        for char in s:
            if char in visited:
                continue
            visited.add(char)
            l, r = s.find(char), s.rfind(char)
            result += len({s[i] for i in range(l + 1, r)})
        return result
```
