You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels..<br>

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.<br><br>

 

**Example 1**:<br>
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```
**Example 2**:<br>
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```
**Note**:<br>
* `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.<br>
* The characters in `J` are distinct.<br>

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in J:
            result += S.count(i)
        return result   
```
