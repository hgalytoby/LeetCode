You are given an integer array  `nums`.

Start by selecting a starting position  `curr`  such that  `nums[curr] == 0`, and choose a movement  **direction**  of
either left or right.

After that, you repeat the following process:

- If  `curr`  is out of the range  `[0, n - 1]`, this process ends.
- If  `nums[curr] == 0`, move in the current direction by  **incrementing**  `curr`  if you are moving right, or  *
  *decrementing**  `curr`  if you are moving left.
- Else if  `nums[curr] > 0`:
    - Decrement  `nums[curr]`  by 1.
    - **Reverse** your movement direction (left becomes right and vice versa).
    - Take a step in your new direction.

A selection of the initial position  `curr`  and movement direction is considered  **valid**  if every element
in  `nums`  becomes 0 by the end of the process.

Return the number of possible  **valid**  selections.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  nums = [1,0,2,0,3]
Output:  2
Explanation:
The only possible valid selections are the following:
-   Choose  `curr = 3`, and a movement direction to the left.
    -   `[1,0,2,**0**,3] -> [1,0,**2**,0,3] -> [1,0,1,**0**,3] -> [1,0,1,0,**3**] -> [1,0,1,**0**,2] -> [1,0,**1**,0,2] -> [1,0,0,**0**,2] -> [1,0,0,0,**2**] -> [1,0,0,**0**,1] -> [1,0,**0**,0,1] -> [1,**0**,0,0,1] -> [**1**,0,0,0,1] -> [0,**0**,0,0,1] -> [0,0,**0**,0,1] -> [0,0,0,**0**,1] -> [0,0,0,0,**1**] -> [0,0,0,0,0]`.
-   Choose  `curr = 3`, and a movement direction to the right.
    -   `[1,0,2,**0**,3] -> [1,0,2,0,**3**] -> [1,0,2,**0**,2] -> [1,0,**2**,0,2] -> [1,0,1,**0**,2] -> [1,0,1,0,**2**] -> [1,0,1,**0**,1] -> [1,0,**1**,0,1] -> [1,0,0,**0**,1] -> [1,0,0,0,**1**] -> [1,0,0,**0**,0] -> [1,0,**0**,0,0] -> [1,**0**,0,0,0] -> [**1**,0,0,0,0] -> [0,0,0,0,0].`
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  nums = [2,3,4,0,4,1,0]
Output:  0
Explanation:
There are no possible valid selections.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- There is at least one element  `i`  where  `nums[i] == 0`.

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def helper(self, i, n, nums, d):
        arr = nums[:]
        direction = [1, -1]
        i += direction[d]
        while 0 <= i < n:
            if arr[i] > 0:
                d = (d + 1) % 2
                arr[i] -= 1
            i += direction[d]
        return int(all(num == 0 for num in arr))

    def countValidSelections(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                result += self.helper(i, n, nums, 0) + self.helper(i, n, nums, 1)
        return result
```
