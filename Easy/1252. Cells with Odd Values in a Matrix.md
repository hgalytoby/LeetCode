Given `n` and `m` which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array  `indices` where  `indices[i] = [ri, ci]`. For each pair of  `[ri, ci]` you have to increment all cells in row  `ri`  and column  `ci` by 1.<br>

Return  _the number of cells with odd values_  in the matrix after applying the increment to all  `indices`.<br><br>

**Example 1:**<br>

```
Input: n = 2, m = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix will be [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]] which contains 6 odd numbers.
```
**Example 2:**<br>
![image](https://i.imgur.com/NW3pmSN.png)
```
Input: n = 2, m = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There is no odd number in the final matrix.
```

<br>**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 50`
-   `1 <= m <= 50`
-   `1 <= indices.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= indices[i][0] < n`
-   `0 <= indices[i][1] < m`

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def oddCells(self, n: int, m: int, indices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        array = []
        result = 0
        for i in range(n):
            array.append([0] * m)
        for i in indices:
            for j, m in enumerate(i):
                if j % 2 == 0:
                    for res_n in range(len(array[m])):
                        array[m][res_n] += 1
                else:
                    for res_m in range(len(array)):
                        array[res_m][m] += 1
        for i in array:
            for j in i:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    result += 1
        return result
```
