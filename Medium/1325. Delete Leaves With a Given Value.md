Given a binary tree  `root`  and an integer  `target`, delete all the  **leaf nodes**  with value  `target`.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value  `target`**,** if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the
value  `target`, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/09/sample_1_1684.png)**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
```

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/09/sample_2_1684.png)**

```
Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
```

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/15/sample_3_1684.png)**

```
Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 3000]`.
- `1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000`

### Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def removeLeafNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None
        root.left = self.removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)
        root.right = self.removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)
        if root.val != target or root.left or root.right:
            return root
        return None
```
