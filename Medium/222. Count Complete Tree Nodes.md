Given the  `root`  of a  **complete**  binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to  **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between  `1`  and  `2h`  nodes inclusive at the last level  `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Const
raints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[0, 5 * 104]`.
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
-   The tree is guaranteed to be  **complete**.


### Python
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            count = 0
            if node:
                count += 1
                count += dfs(node.left)
                count += dfs(node.right)
            return count
                
        return dfs(root)
```
