In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has  `n`  empty baskets, the  `ith`  basket is at  `position[i]`, Morty has  `m`  balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the  **minimum magnetic force**  between any two balls is  **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions  `x`  and  `y`  is  `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array  `position`  and the integer  `m`. Return  _the required force_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/11/q3v1.jpg)
```
Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
Output: 999999999
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == position.length`
-   `2 <= n <= 105`
-   `1 <= position[i] <= 109`
-   All integers in  `position`  are  **distinct**.
-   `2 <= m <= position.length`


### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def is_ok(self, position, mid, m):
        last, balls = position[0], 1
        for i in range(1, len(position)):
            if position[i] - last >= mid:
                last = position[i]
                balls += 1
                if balls == m:
                    return True
        return False

    def maxDistance(self, position: List[int], m: int) -> int:
        position.sort()
        left, right = 1, position[-1] - position[0]
        result = 0
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if self.is_ok(position, mid, m):
                result = mid
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return result
```
