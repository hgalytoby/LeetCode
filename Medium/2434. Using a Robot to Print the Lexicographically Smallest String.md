You are given a string  `s`  and a robot that currently holds an empty string  `t`. Apply one of the following
operations until  `s`  and  `t`  **are both empty**:

- Remove the  **first**  character of a string  `s`  and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to
  the string  `t`.
- Remove the  **last**  character of a string  `t`  and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on
  paper.

Return  _the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "zza"
Output: "azz"
Explanation: Let p denote the written string.
Initially p="", s="zza", t="".
Perform first operation three times p="", s="", t="zza".
Perform second operation three times p="azz", s="", t="".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bac"
Output: "abc"
Explanation: Let p denote the written string.
Perform first operation twice p="", s="c", t="ba". 
Perform second operation twice p="ab", s="c", t="". 
Perform first operation p="ab", s="", t="c". 
Perform second operation p="abc", s="", t="".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bdda"
Output: "addb"
Explanation: Let p denote the written string.
Initially p="", s="bdda", t="".
Perform first operation four times p="", s="", t="bdda".
Perform second operation four times p="addb", s="", t="".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s`  consists of only English lowercase letters.

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def robotWithString(self, s: str) -> str:
        freq = Counter(s)
        stack = []
        result = []

        def min_char(freq):
            for i in range(26):
                ch = chr(ord('a') + i)
                if freq[ch] > 0:
                    return ch
            return 'a'

        for char in s:
            stack.append(char)
            freq[char] -= 1
            while stack and stack[-1] <= min_char(freq):
                result.append(stack.pop())
        while stack:
            result.append(stack.pop())
        return ''.join(result)
