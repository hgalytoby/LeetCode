You are given an integer array  `nums`  of size  `n`  containing only  `1`  and  `-1`, and an integer  `k`.

You can perform the following operation at most  `k`  times:

- Choose an index  `i`  (`0 <= i < n - 1`), and  **multiply**  both  `nums[i]`  and  `nums[i + 1]`  by  `-1`.

**Note**  that you can choose the same index  `i`  more than once in  **different**  operations.

Return  `true`  if it is possible to make all elements of the array  **equal**  after at most  `k`  operations,
and  `false`  otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  nums = [1,-1,1,-1,1], k = 3
Output:  true
Explanation:
We can make all elements in the array equal in 2 operations as follows:
-   Choose index  `i = 1`, and multiply both  `nums[1]`  and  `nums[2]`  by -1. Now  `nums = [1,1,-1,-1,1]`.
-   Choose index  `i = 2`, and multiply both  `nums[2]`  and  `nums[3]`  by -1. Now  `nums = [1,1,1,1,1]`.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  nums = [-1,-1,-1,1,1,1], k = 5
Output:  false
Explanation:
It is not possible to make all array elements equal in at most 5 operations.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]`  is either -1 or 1.
- `1 <= k <= n`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def helper(self, nums, k, target):
        n = len(nums)
        i = 0
        while i < n - 1 and k > 0:
            if nums[i] != target:
                k -= 1
                nums[i + 1] *= -1
                nums[i] = target
            i += 1
        return all(nums[j] == target for j in range(i, n))

    def canMakeEqual(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        return self.helper(nums[:], k, 1) or self.helper(nums, k, -1)
