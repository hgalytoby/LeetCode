Given a  **1-indexed**  array of integers  `numbers`  that is already  **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific  `target`  number. Let these two numbers be  `numbers[index1]`  and  `numbers[index2]`  where  `1 <= index1  < index2  <= numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers,_ `index1` _and_ `index2`_,  **added by one**  as an integer array_ `[index1, index2]` _of length 2._

The tests are generated such that there is  **exactly one solution**. You  **may not**  use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers`  is sorted in  **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is  **exactly one solution**.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        while True:
            result = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if result == target:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]
            r, l = (r - 1, l) if result > target else (r, l + 1)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        data = {}
        for i in range(len(numbers) - 1, -1, -1):
            _ = target - numbers[i]
            if _ in data and i != data[_]:
                return [i + 1, data[_] + 1]
            data[numbers[i]] = i
