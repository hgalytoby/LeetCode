Given the coordinates of two  **rectilinear**  rectangles in a 2D plane, return  _the total area covered by the two
rectangles_.

The first rectangle is defined by its  **bottom-left**  corner  `(ax1, ay1)`  and its  **top-right**
corner  `(ax2, ay2)`.

The second rectangle is defined by its  **bottom-left**  corner  `(bx1, by1)`  and its  **top-right**
corner  `(bx2, by2)`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
**Output:** 45
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2
**Output:** 16
```

**Constraints:**

- `-104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104`
- `-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104`
- `-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104`
- `-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def computeArea(self, ax1: int, ay1: int, ax2: int, ay2: int, bx1: int, by1: int, bx2: int, by2: int) -> int:
        area_a = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)
        area_b = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)
        overlap_width = min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)
        overlap_height = min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1)
        overlap_area = max(overlap_width, 0) * max(overlap_height, 0)
        return area_a + area_b - overlap_area
```
