Given a string  `s`, partition it into  **unique segments**  according to the following procedure:

- Start building a segment beginning at index 0.
- Continue extending the current segment character by character until the current segment has not been seen before.
- Once the segment is unique, add it to your list of segments, mark it as seen, and begin a new segment from the next
  index.
- Repeat until you reach the end of  `s`.

Return an array of strings  `segments`, where  `segments[i]`  is the  `ith`  segment created.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  s = "abbccccd"
Output:  ["a","b","bc","c","cc","d"]
Explanation:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  s = "aaaa"
Output:  ["a","aa"]
Explanation:
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s`  contains only lowercase English letters.

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def partitionString(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        visited = set()
        cur = ''
        result = []
        for char in s:
            cur += char
            if cur not in visited:
                result.append(cur)
                visited.add(cur)
                cur = ''
        return result
```
