Given a string  `s`  and a dictionary of strings  `wordDict`, return  `true`  if  `s`  can be segmented into a
space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note**  that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 300`
- `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
- `s`  and  `wordDict[i]`  consist of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of  `wordDict`  are  **unique**.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        word_set, queue, seen = set(wordDict), deque([0]), set()
        while queue:
            start = queue.popleft()
            if start == len(s):
                return True
            for i in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                if i in seen:
                    continue
                if s[start:i] in word_set:
                    queue.append(i)
                    seen.add(i)
        return False
```
