You are given  `m`  `arrays`, where each array is sorted in  **ascending order**.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the
distance between two integers  `a`  and  `b`  to be their absolute difference  `|a - b|`.

Return  _the maximum distance_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arrays = [[1],[1]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == arrays.length`
- `2 <= m <= 105`
- `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 500`
- `-104 <= arrays[i][j] <= 104`
- `arrays[i]`  is sorted in  **ascending order**.
- There will be at most  `105`  integers in all the arrays.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, arrays: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        max_v, min_v = arrays[0][-1], arrays[0][0]
        result = 0
        for i in range(1, len(arrays)):
            result = max(result, abs(max_v - arrays[i][0]), abs(min_v - arrays[i][-1]))
            max_v = max(max_v, arrays[i][-1])
            min_v = min(min_v, arrays[i][0])
        return result
```
