You are given a 2D integer array  `intervals`  where  `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]`  represents the  **inclusive**
interval  `[lefti, righti]`.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more  **groups**  such that each interval is in  **exactly**  one group,
and no two intervals that are in the same group  **intersect**  each other.

Return  _the  **minimum**  number of groups you need to make_.

Two intervals  **intersect**  if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals  `[1, 5]`
and  `[5, 8]`  intersect.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can divide the intervals into the following groups:
- Group 1: [1, 5], [6, 8].
- Group 2: [2, 3], [5, 10].
- Group 3: [1, 10].
It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than 3 groups.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 106`

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def minGroups(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()
        group = []
        for s, e in intervals:
            if group and s > group[0]:
                heappop(group)
            heappush(group, e)
        return len(group)
```
