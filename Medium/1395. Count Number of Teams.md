There are `n` soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a  **unique**  `rating`  value.<br>

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

-   Choose 3 soldiers with index (`i`,  `j`,  `k`) with rating (`rating[i]`,  `rating[j]`,  `rating[k]`).
-   A team is valid if: (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]`) or (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`) where (`0 <= i < j < k < n`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).<br><br>


**Example 1:**
```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == rating.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 200`
-   `1 <= rating[i] <= 10^5`

### Python
```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def numTeams(self, rating: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        n = len(rating)
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            left_big = left_small = 0
            right_big = right_small = 0
            for j in range(0, i):
                if rating[i] > rating[j]:
                    left_small += 1
                else:
                    left_big += 1
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if rating[i] < rating[j]:
                    right_big += 1
                else:
                    right_small += 1
            result += right_big * left_small + right_small * left_big
        return result
```
