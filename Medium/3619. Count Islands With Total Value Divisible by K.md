You are given an  `m x n`  matrix  `grid`  and a positive integer  `k`. An  **island**  is a group of  **positive**  integers (representing land) that are  **4-directionally**  connected (horizontally or vertically).

The  **total value**  of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the island.

Return the number of islands with a total value  **divisible by**  `k`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/06/example1griddrawio-1.png)
```
Input:  grid = [[0,2,1,0,0],[0,5,0,0,5],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,4,7,0],[0,2,0,0,8]], k = 5
Output:  2
Explanation:
The grid contains four islands. The islands highlighted in blue have a total value that is divisible by 5, while the islands highlighted in red do not.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/06/example2griddrawio.png)
```
Input:  grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]], k = 3
Output:  6
Explanation:
The grid contains six islands, each with a total value that is divisible by 3.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
-   `1 <= m * n <= 105`
-   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 106`
-   `1 <= k <= 106`


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def countIslands(self, grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        def dfs(i, j, val=0):
            if i < 0 or i == m or j < 0 or j == n or (i, j) in visited or grid[i][j] == 0:
                return val
            grid[i][j] = 0
            return grid[i][j] + dfs(i - 1, j) + dfs(i + 1, j) + dfs(i, j - 1) + dfs(i, j + 1)

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        result, visited = 0, set()
        for r in range(m):
            for c in range(n):
                if grid[r][c] != 0 and dfs(r, c) % k == 0:
                    result += 1
        return result
```
