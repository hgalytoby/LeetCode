Given an array  `nums`  of  `n`  integers, your task is to find the  **maximum**  value of  `k`  for which there exist  **two**  adjacent  subarrays  of length  `k`  each, such that both subarrays are  **strictly**  **increasing**. Specifically, check if there are  **two**  subarrays of length  `k`  starting at indices  `a`  and  `b`  (`a < b`), where:

-   Both subarrays  `nums[a..a + k - 1]`  and  `nums[b..b + k - 1]`  are  **strictly increasing**.
-   The subarrays must be  **adjacent**, meaning  `b = a + k`.

Return the  **maximum**  _possible_  value of  `k`.

A  **subarray**  is a contiguous  **non-empty**  sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1]
Output:  3
Explanation:
-   The subarray starting at index 2 is  `[7, 8, 9]`, which is strictly increasing.
-   The subarray starting at index 5 is  `[2, 3, 4]`, which is also strictly increasing.
-   These two subarrays are adjacent, and 3 is the  **maximum**  possible value of  `k`  for which two such adjacent strictly increasing subarrays exist.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7]
Output:  2
Explanation:
-   The subarray starting at index 0 is  `[1, 2]`, which is strictly increasing.
-   The subarray starting at index 2 is  `[3, 4]`, which is also strictly increasing.
-   These two subarrays are adjacent, and 2 is the  **maximum**  possible value of  `k`  for which two such adjacent strictly increasing subarrays exist.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105`
-   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def maxIncreasingSubarrays(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        arr = []
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if arr and nums[i] > nums[arr[-1][-1]]:
                arr[-1][-1] = i
            else:
                arr.append([i, i])
        result = (arr[0][1] + 1 - arr[0][0]) // 2
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            cur_l, cur_r = arr[i]
            prev_l, prev_r = arr[i - 1]
            cur = (cur_r + 1 - cur_l) // 2
            marge = min(cur_r - cur_l, prev_r - prev_l) + 1 if cur_l - prev_r == 1 else 0
            result = max(result, cur, marge)
        return result
