You are given the  `head`  of a  **non-empty**  linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return  _the_ `head` _of the linked list after  **doubling**  it_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/28/example.png)

```
Input: head = [1,8,9]
Output: [3,7,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/28/example2.png)

```
Input: head = [9,9,9]
Output: [1,9,9,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[1, 104]`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number  `0`
  itself.

### Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def doubleIt(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        parent = dummy
        while head:
            v = head.val * 2
            if v > 9:
                parent.val += 1
            head.val = v % 10
            parent = parent.next    
            head = head.next
        return dummy if dummy.val else dummy.next
```
