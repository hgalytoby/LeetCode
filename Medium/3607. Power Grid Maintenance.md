You are given an integer  `c`  representing  `c`  power stations, each with a unique identifier  `id`  from 1 to  `c`  (
1‑based indexing).

These stations are interconnected via  `n`  **bidirectional**  cables, represented by a 2D array  `connections`, where
each element  `connections[i] = [ui, vi]`  indicates a connection between station  `ui`  and station  `vi`. Stations
that are directly or indirectly connected form a  **power grid**.

Initially,  **all**  stations are online (operational).

You are also given a 2D array  `queries`, where each query is one of the following  _two_  types:

- `[1, x]`: A maintenance check is requested for station  `x`. If station  `x`  is online, it resolves the check by
  itself. If station  `x`  is offline, the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest  `id`  in the
  same  **power grid**  as  `x`. If  **no**  **operational**  station  _exists_  in that grid, return -1.

- `[2, x]`: Station  `x`  goes offline (i.e., it becomes non-operational).

Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type  `[1, x]`  in the  **order**  they appear.

**Note:**  The power grid preserves its structure; an offline (non‑operational) node remains part of its grid and taking
it offline does not alter connectivity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  c = 5, connections = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], queries = [[1,3],[2,1],[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]]
Output:  [3,2,3]
Explanation:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/04/15/powergrid.jpg)
-   Initially, all stations  `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`  are online and form a single power grid.
-   Query  `[1,3]`: Station 3 is online, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 3.
-   Query  `[2,1]`: Station 1 goes offline. The remaining online stations are  `{2, 3, 4, 5}`.
-   Query  `[1,1]`: Station 1 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest  `id`  among  `{2, 3, 4, 5}`, which is station 2.
-   Query  `[2,2]`: Station 2 goes offline. The remaining online stations are  `{3, 4, 5}`.
-   Query  `[1,2]`: Station 2 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest  `id`  among  `{3, 4, 5}`, which is station 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  c = 3, connections = [], queries = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]]
Output:  [1,-1]
Explanation:
-   There are no connections, so each station is its own isolated grid.
-   Query  `[1,1]`: Station 1 is online in its isolated grid, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 1.
-   Query  `[2,1]`: Station 1 goes offline.
-   Query  `[1,1]`: Station 1 is offline and there are no other stations in its grid, so the result is -1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= c <= 105`
- `0 <= n == connections.length <= min(105, c * (c - 1) / 2)`
- `connections[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= c`
- `ui != vi`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 2 * 105`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `queries[i][0]`  is either 1 or 2.
- `1 <= queries[i][1] <= c`

```py

    def processQueries(self, c: int, connections: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

        for u, v in connections:

        for n in range(1, c + 1):
            dfs(n, n)
        todo = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(c, 0, -1):
            todo[seen[i]].append(i)
        result = []
        online = [1] * (c + 1)
        for o, x in queries:
            if o == 2:
                online[x] = 0
            elif online[x]:
                result.append(x)
            else:
                y = seen[x]
                while todo[y] and online[todo[y][-1]] == 0:
                    todo[y].pop()
                result.append(todo[y][-1] if todo[y] else -1)
