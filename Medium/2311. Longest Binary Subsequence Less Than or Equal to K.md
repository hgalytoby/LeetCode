You are given a binary string  `s`  and a positive integer  `k`.

Return  _the length of the  **longest**  subsequence of_ `s` _that makes up a  **binary**  number less than or equal
to_  `k`.

Note:

- The subsequence can contain  **leading zeroes**.
- The empty string is considered to be equal to  `0`.
- A  **subsequence**  is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without
  changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "00101001", k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.
The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]`  is either  `'0'`  or  `'1'`.
- `1 <= k <= 109`

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        cur = ""
        n = len(s)
        one_count = s.count("1")
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            cur = s[i] + cur
            if int(cur, 2) > k:
                return n - one_count
            if s[i] == '1':
                one_count -= 1
        return n
```
