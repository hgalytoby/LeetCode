It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.

At the store, there are  `n`  ice cream bars. You are given an array  `costs`  of length  `n`, where  `costs[i]`  is the price of the  `ith`  ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has  `coins`  coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible.

Return  _the  **maximum**  number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with_ `coins` _coins._

**Note:**  The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `costs.length == n`
-   `1 <= n <= 105`
-   `1 <= costs[i] <= 105`
-   `1 <= coins <= 108`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        costs.sort(reverse=True)
        while coins > 0 and costs: 
            coins -= costs.pop()
            if coins >= 0:
                result += 1
        return result
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        costs.sort()
        for cost in costs:
            coins -= cost
            if coins < 0:
                return result
            result += 1
        return result
```
