You are given an array of equal-length strings  `words`. Assume that the length of each string is  `n`.

Each string  `words[i]`  can be converted into a  **difference integer array**  `difference[i]`  of length  `n - 1`
where  `difference[i][j] = words[i][j+1] - words[i][j]`  where  `0 <= j <= n - 2`. Note that the difference between two
letters is the difference between their  **positions**  in the alphabet i.e. the position of  `'a'`  is  `0`,  `'b'`
is  `1`, and  `'z'`  is  `25`.

- For example, for the string  `"acb"`, the difference integer array is  `[2 - 0, 1 - 2] = [2, -1]`.

All the strings in words have the same difference integer array,  **except one**. You should find that string.

Return _the string in_ `words` _that has different  **difference integer array**._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["adc","wzy","abc"]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: 
- The difference integer array of "adc" is [3 - 0, 2 - 3] = [3, -1].
- The difference integer array of "wzy" is [25 - 22, 24 - 25]= [3, -1].
- The difference integer array of "abc" is [1 - 0, 2 - 1] = [1, 1]. 
The odd array out is [1, 1], so we return the corresponding string, "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["aaa","bob","ccc","ddd"]
Output: "bob"
Explanation: All the integer arrays are [0, 0] except for "bob", which corresponds to [13, -13].
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= words.length <= 100`
- `n == words[i].length`
- `2 <= n <= 20`
- `words[i]`  consists of lowercase English letters.
