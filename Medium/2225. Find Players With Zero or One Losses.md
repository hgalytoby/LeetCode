You are given an integer array  `matches`  where  `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]`  indicates that the player  `winneri`  defeated player  `loseri`  in a match.

Return  _a list_ `answer` _of size_ `2` _where:_

-   `answer[0]`  is a list of all players that have  **not**  lost any matches.
-   `answer[1]`  is a list of all players that have lost exactly  **one**  match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in  **increasing**  order.

**Note:**

-   You should only consider the players that have played  **at least one**  match.
-   The testcases will be generated such that  **no**  two matches will have the  **same**  outcome.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= matches.length <= 105`
-   `matches[i].length == 2`
-   `1 <= winneri, loseri  <= 105`
-   `winneri  != loseri`
-   All  `matches[i]`  are  **unique**.
