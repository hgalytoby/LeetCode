You are given two strings,  `s`  and  `t`.

You can create a new string by selecting a substring from  `s`  (possibly empty) and a substring from  `t`  (possibly
empty), then concatenating them  **in order**.

Return the length of the  **longest**  palindrome that can be formed this way.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  s = "a", t = "a"
Output:  2
Explanation:
Concatenating  `"a"`  from  `s`  and  `"a"`  from  `t`  results in  `"aa"`, which is a palindrome of length 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  s = "abc", t = "def"
Output:  1
Explanation:
Since all characters are different, the longest palindrome is any single character, so the answer is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:  s = "b", t = "aaaa"
Output:  4
Explanation:
Selecting "`aaaa`" from  `t`  is the longest palindrome, so the answer is 4.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input:  s = "abcde", t = "ecdba"
Output:  5
Explanation:
Concatenating  `"abc"`  from  `s`  and  `"ba"`  from  `t`  results in  `"abcba"`, which is a palindrome of length 5.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 30`
- `s`  and  `t`  consist of lowercase English letters.

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        s_n, t_n = len(s), len(t)
        for i in range(s_n):
            for j in range(i, s_n + 1):
                s1 = s[i:j]
                for k in range(t_n):
                    for l in range(k, t_n + 1):
                        combine = s1 + t[k:l]
                        if combine == combine[::-1]:
                            result = max(result, len(combine))
        return result
```
