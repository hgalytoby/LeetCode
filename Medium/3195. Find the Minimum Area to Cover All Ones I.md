You are given a 2D  **binary**  array  `grid`. Find a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides with the **smallest**
area, such that all the 1's in  `grid`  lie inside this rectangle.

Return the  **minimum**  possible area of the rectangle.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output:  6
Explanation:
```

The smallest rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so it has an area of  `2 * 3 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  grid = [[0,0],[1,0]]
Output:  1
Explanation:
```

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/05/08/examplerect1.png)

The smallest rectangle has both height and width 1, so its area is  `1 * 1 = 1`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000`
- `grid[i][j]`  is either 0 or 1.
- The input is generated such that there is at least one 1 in  `grid`.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumArea(self, grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        left, right, top, bottom = math.inf, 0, math.inf, 0
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == 1:
                    top = min(top, row)
                    bottom = max(bottom, row)
                    left = min(left, col)
                    right = max(right, col)
        return (bottom - top + 1) * (right - left + 1)
```
