You are given a 2D string array  `responses`  where each  `responses[i]`  is an array of strings representing survey responses from the  `ith`  day.

Return the  **most common**  response across all days after removing  **duplicate**  responses within each  `responses[i]`. If there is a tie, return the  _lexicographically smallest_  response.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  responses = [["good","ok","good","ok"],["ok","bad","good","ok","ok"],["good"],["bad"]]
Output:  "good"
Explanation:
-   After removing duplicates within each list,  `responses = [["good", "ok"], ["ok", "bad", "good"], ["good"], ["bad"]]`.
-   `"good"`  appears 3 times,  `"ok"`  appears 2 times, and  `"bad"`  appears 2 times.
-   Return  `"good"`  because it has the highest frequency.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  responses = [["good","ok","good"],["ok","bad"],["bad","notsure"],["great","good"]]
Output:  "bad"
Explanation:
-   After removing duplicates within each list we have  `responses = [["good", "ok"], ["ok", "bad"], ["bad", "notsure"], ["great", "good"]]`.
-   `"bad"`,  `"good"`, and  `"ok"`  each occur 2 times.
-   The output is  `"bad"`  because it is the lexicographically smallest amongst the words with the highest frequency.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= responses.length <= 1000`
-   `1 <= responses[i].length <= 1000`
-   `1 <= responses[i][j].length <= 10`
-   `responses[i][j]`  consists of only lowercase English letters


### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findCommonResponse(self, responses: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        counter = Counter()
        for response in responses:
            for item in set(response):
                counter[item] += 1
        max_v = max(counter.values())
        total = [k for k, v in counter.items() if v == max_v]
        return min(total)
```
