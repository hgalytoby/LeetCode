The  **count-and-say**  sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)`  is the run-length encoding of  `countAndSay(n - 1)`.

[Run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)  (RLE) is a string compression method that works
by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the
number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string  `"3322251"`  we
replace  `"33"`  with  `"23"`, replace  `"222"`  with  `"32"`, replace  `"5"`  with  `"15"`  and replace  `"1"`
with  `"11"`. Thus the compressed string becomes  `"23321511"`.

Given a positive integer  `n`, return  _the_ `nth` _element of the  **count-and-say**  sequence_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  n = 4
Output:  "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = RLE of "1" = "11"
countAndSay(3) = RLE of "11" = "21"
countAndSay(4) = RLE of "21" = "1211"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  n = 1
Output:  "1"
Explanation:
This is the base case.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 30`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        result = "1"
        for i in range(n - 1):
            arr = []
            for j in range(len(result)):
                if not arr:
                    arr.append([result[j], 1])
                elif arr[-1][0] == result[j]:
                    arr[-1][1] += 1
                else:
                    arr.append([result[j], 1])
            result = "".join(str(arr[j][1]) + arr[j][0] for j in range(len(arr)))
        return result
```
