There are  `n`  cities numbered from  `0`  to  `n-1`. Given the array  `edges`
where  `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]`  represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities  `fromi`
and  `toi`, and given the integer  `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is  **at most
**  `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities  _**i**_  and  _**j**_  is equal to the sum of the edges' weights
along that path.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_01.png)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_02.png)

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi < toi < n`
- `1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4`
- All pairs  `(fromi, toi)`  are distinct.

            for city, dist in graph[cur_city]:
                distance = cur_dist + dist

                if distance < distances[city]:

            reachable_cities = sum(
                dist <= distanceThreshold for dist in distances.values()
            )

            if reachable_cities < min_reachable_cities or (
                reachable_cities == min_reachable_cities and i > result_city
            ):
                min_reachable_cities = reachable_cities
                result_city = i
