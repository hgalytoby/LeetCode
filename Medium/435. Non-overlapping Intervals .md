Given an array of intervals  `intervals`  where  `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return  _the minimum number of
intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        result, v = 0, intervals[0][1]
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] >= v:
                v = intervals[i][1]
            else:
                result += 1
        return result
```
