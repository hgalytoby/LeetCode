There are  `n`  balls on a table, each ball has a color black or white.

You are given a  **0-indexed**  binary string  `s`  of length  `n`, where  `1`  and  `0`  represent black and white
balls, respectively.

In each step, you can choose two adjacent balls and swap them.

Return  _the  **minimum**  number of steps to group all the black balls to the right and all the white balls to the
left_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "101"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "011".
Initially, 1s are not grouped together, requiring at least 1 step to group them to the right.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "100"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "010".
- Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "001".
It can be proven that the minimum number of steps needed is 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "0111"
Output: 0
Explanation: All the black balls are already grouped to the right.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]`  is either  `'0'`  or  `'1'`.

        zero_count = len(zero_index)
        one_count = n - zero_count
        target = '0' * zero_count + '1' * one_count
        result = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if zero_index and s[i] == "1" and s[i] != target[i]:
                index = zero_index.pop()
                result += index - i
        return result
