You are given two strings  `s`  and  `t`  of the same length, and two integer arrays  `nextCost`  and  `previousCost`.

In one operation, you can pick any index  `i`  of  `s`, and perform  **either one**  of the following actions:

- Shift  `s[i]`  to the next letter in the alphabet. If  `s[i] == 'z'`, you should replace it with  `'a'`. This
  operation costs  `nextCost[j]`  where  `j`  is the index of  `s[i]`  in the alphabet.
- Shift  `s[i]`  to the previous letter in the alphabet. If  `s[i] == 'a'`, you should replace it with  `'z'`. This
  operation costs  `previousCost[j]`  where  `j`  is the index of  `s[i]`  in the alphabet.

The  **shift distance**  is the  **minimum**  total cost of operations required to transform  `s`  into  `t`.

Return the  **shift distance**  from  `s`  to  `t`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  s = "abab", t = "baba", nextCost = [100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], previousCost = [1,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output:  2
Explanation:
-   We choose index  `i = 0`  and shift  `s[0]`  25 times to the previous character for a total cost of 1.
-   We choose index  `i = 1`  and shift  `s[1]`  25 times to the next character for a total cost of 0.
-   We choose index  `i = 2`  and shift  `s[2]`  25 times to the previous character for a total cost of 1.
-   We choose index  `i = 3`  and shift  `s[3]`  25 times to the next character for a total cost of 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  s = "leet", t = "code", nextCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], previousCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output:  31
Explanation:
-   We choose index  `i = 0`  and shift  `s[0]`  9 times to the previous character for a total cost of 9.
-   We choose index  `i = 1`  and shift  `s[1]`  10 times to the next character for a total cost of 10.
-   We choose index  `i = 2`  and shift  `s[2]`  1 time to the previous character for a total cost of 1.
-   We choose index  `i = 3`  and shift  `s[3]`  11 times to the next character for a total cost of 11.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length == t.length <= 105`
- `s`  and  `t`  consist only of lowercase English letters.
- `nextCost.length == previousCost.length == 26`
- `0 <= nextCost[i], previousCost[i] <= 109`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def shiftDistance(self, s: str, t: str, nextCost: List[int], previousCost: List[int]) -> int:
        next_arr = nextCost * 2
        perv_arr = previousCost * 2
        char_set = set(s + t)
        next_point, perv_point = defaultdict(dict), defaultdict(dict)
        for i in range(26):
            cur = chr(97 + i)
            if cur not in char_set:
                continue
            next_count = prev_count = 0
            for j in range(1, 26):
                next_char = chr(97 + (i + j) % 26)
                prev_char = chr(97 + (i - j) % 26)
                next_count += next_arr[i + j - 1]
                prev_count += perv_arr[i - j + 1 + 26]
                next_point[cur].update({next_char: next_count})
                perv_point[cur].update({prev_char: prev_count})
        return sum(min(next_point[c][target], perv_point[c][target]) for c, target in zip(s, t) if c != target)
