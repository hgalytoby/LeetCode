You are given two strings  `start`  and  `target`, both of length  `n`. Each string consists  **only**  of the
characters  `'L'`,  `'R'`, and  `'_'`  where:

- The characters  `'L'`  and  `'R'`  represent pieces, where a piece  `'L'`  can move to the  **left**  only if there is
  a  **blank**  space directly to its left, and a piece  `'R'`  can move to the  **right**  only if there is a  **blank
  **  space directly to its right.
- The character  `'_'`  represents a blank space that can be occupied by  **any**  of the  `'L'`  or  `'R'`  pieces.

Return  `true`  _if it is possible to obtain the string_  `target` _by moving the pieces of the string_ `start` _**any**
number of times_. Otherwise, return  `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: start = "_L__R__R_", target = "L______RR"
Output: true
Explanation: We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to "**L**___R__R_".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to "L___R___**R**".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to "L______**R**R".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: start = "R_L_", target = "__LR"
Output: false
Explanation: The 'R' piece in the string start can move one step to the right to obtain "_**R**L_".
After that, no pieces can move anymore, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: start = "_R", target = "R_"
Output: false
Explanation: The piece in the string start can move only to the right, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == start.length == target.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `start`  and  `target`  consist of the characters  `'L'`,  `'R'`, and  `'_'`.

```python
class Solution:
    def canChange(self, start: str, target: str) -> bool:
        start_index = target_index = 0
        n = len(start)
        while start_index < n or target_index < n:
            while start_index < n and start[start_index] == "_":
                start_index += 1
            while target_index < n and target[target_index] == "_":
                target_index += 1
            if start_index == n or target_index == n:
                return start_index == target_index
            if (
                start[start_index] != target[target_index]
                or start[start_index] == "L"
                and start_index < target_index
                or start[start_index] == "R"
                and start_index > target_index
            ):
                return False
            start_index += 1
            target_index += 1
        return start_index == target_index
