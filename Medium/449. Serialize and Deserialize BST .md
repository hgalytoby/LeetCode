Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or
memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer
environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a  **binary search tree**. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a
string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[0, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
- The input tree is  **guaranteed**  to be a binary search tree.

### Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        """
        if not root:
            return ''
        nodes = deque([root])
        result = []
        while nodes:
            node = nodes.popleft()
            if node:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                nodes.append(node.left)
                nodes.append(node.right)
            else:
                result.append('None')
        return ','.join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        """
        if not data:
            return
        nodes = data.split(',')
        tree = TreeNode(int(nodes[0]))
        queue = deque([tree])
        i = 1
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if nodes[i] != 'None':
                current.left = TreeNode(nodes[i])
                queue.append(current.left)
            i += 1
            if nodes[i] != 'None':
                current.right = TreeNode(nodes[i])
                queue.append(current.right)
            i += 1
        return tree
