Given the  `root`  of a binary search tree, and an integer  `k`, return  _the_  `kth`  _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is  `n`.
-   `1 <= k <= n <= 104`
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Follow up:**  If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?


### Python
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        result = []
        def inorder(node):
            if not node:
                return 
            inorder(node.left)
            result.append(node.val)
            inorder(node.right)
        inorder(root)
        return result[k - 1]
```
