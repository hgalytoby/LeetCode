You are given a  **0-indexed**  integer array  `players`, where  `players[i]`  represents the  **ability**  of the  `ith`  player. You are also given a  **0-indexed**  integer array  `trainers`, where  `trainers[j]`  represents the  **training capacity** of the  `jth`  trainer.

The  `ith`  player can  **match**  with the  `jth`  trainer if the player's ability is  **less than or equal to**  the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the  `ith`  player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the  `jth`  trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return  _the  **maximum**  number of matchings between_ `players` _and_ `trainers` _that satisfy these conditions._

**Example 1:**
```
Input: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]
Output: 2
Explanation:
One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:
- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.
- players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.
Each player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= players.length, trainers.length <= 105`
-   `1 <= players[i], trainers[j] <= 109`
