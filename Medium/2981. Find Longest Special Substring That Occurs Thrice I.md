You are given a string  `s`  that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called  **special**  if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string  `"abc"`  is not
special, whereas the strings  `"ddd"`,  `"zz"`, and  `"f"`  are special.

Return  _the length of the  **longest special substring**  of_ `s`  _which occurs  **at least thrice**_,  _or_ `-1` _if
no special substring occurs at least thrice_.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous  **non-empty**  sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "**aa**aa", "a**aa**a", and "aa**aa**".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcdef"
Output: -1
Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcaba"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "**a**bcaba", "abc**a**ba", and "abcab**a**".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 50`
- `s`  consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        counter = Counter()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            char = s[i]
            for j in range(i, len(s)):
                if s[j] == char:
                    counter[char * (j - i + 1)] += 1
                else:
                    break
        result = -1
        for char, freq in counter.items():
            if freq >= 3:
                result = max(result, len(char))
        return result
