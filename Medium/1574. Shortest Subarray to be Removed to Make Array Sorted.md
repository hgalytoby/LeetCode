Given an integer array  `arr`, remove a subarray (can be empty) from  `arr`  such that the remaining elements in  `arr`
are  **non-decreasing**.

Return  _the length of the shortest subarray to remove_.

A  **subarray**  is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.
Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array is already non-decreasing. We do not need to remove any elements.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 109`

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfShortestSubarray(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        right = n - 1
        while right > 0 and arr[right] >= arr[right - 1]:
            right -= 1
        result = right
        for i in range(0, right):
            if i == 0 or arr[i - 1] <= arr[i]:
                while right < n and arr[i] > arr[right]:
                    right += 1
                result = min(result, right - i - 1)
            else:
                break
        return result
```
