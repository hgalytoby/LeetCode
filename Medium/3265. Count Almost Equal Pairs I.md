You are given an array  `nums`  consisting of positive integers.

We call two integers  `x`  and  `y`  in this problem  **almost equal**  if both integers can become equal after
performing the following operation  **at most once**:

- Choose  **either**  `x`  or  `y`  and swap any two digits within the chosen number.

Return the number of indices  `i`  and  `j`  in  `nums`  where  `i < j`  such that  `nums[i]`  and  `nums[j]`  are  *
*almost equal**.

**Note**  that it is allowed for an integer to have leading zeros after performing an operation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  nums = [3,12,30,17,21]
Output:  2
Explanation:
The almost equal pairs of elements are:
-   3 and 30. By swapping 3 and 0 in 30, you get 3.
-   12 and 21. By swapping 1 and 2 in 12, you get 21.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output:  10
Explanation:
Every two elements in the array are almost equal.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:  nums = [123,231]
Output:  0
Explanation:
We cannot swap any two digits of 123 or 231 to reach the other.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`

        result = 0
        for i in range(n):

            for j in range(i + 1, n):

                if len(n1) >= len(n2):
                    v1 = '0' * (len(n1) - len(n2)) + n2

                    if a != b:
                        count += 1
                    if count > 2:
                        break
                else:
                    result += sorted(v1) == sorted(v2)
        return result
