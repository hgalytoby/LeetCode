You are given a string  `s`  that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a  **non-empty**  key.

- For example, in the string  `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are  **two**  bracket pairs that contain the
  keys  `"name"`  and  `"age"`.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array  `knowledge`  where
each  `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]`  indicates that key  `keyi`  has a value of  `valuei`.

You are tasked to evaluate  **all**  of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some
key  `keyi`, you will:

- Replace  `keyi`  and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding  `valuei`.
- If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace  `keyi`  and the bracket pair with a question mark  `"?"`  (
  without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your  `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in  `s`.

Return  _the resulting string after evaluating  **all**  of the bracket pairs._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]
Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
Explanation:
The key "name" has a value of "bob", so replace "(name)" with "bob".
The key "age" has a value of "two", so replace "(age)" with "two".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "hi(name)", knowledge = [["a","b"]]
Output: "hi?"
Explanation: As you do not know the value of the key "name", replace "(name)" with "?".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]
Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
Explanation: The same key can appear multiple times.
The key "a" has a value of "yes", so replace all occurrences of "(a)" with "yes".
Notice that the "a"s not in a bracket pair are not evaluated.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `0 <= knowledge.length <= 105`
- `knowledge[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= keyi.length, valuei.length <= 10`
- `s`  consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets  `'('`  and  `')'`.
- Every open bracket  `'('`  in  `s`  will have a corresponding close bracket  `')'`.
- The key in each bracket pair of  `s`  will be non-empty.
- There will not be any nested bracket pairs in  `s`.
- `keyi`  and  `valuei`  consist of lowercase English letters.
- Each  `keyi`  in  `knowledge`  is unique.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def evaluate(self, s: str, knowledge: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        hash_map = {k: v for k, v in knowledge}
        result, flag, index = '', False, 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '(':
                index = i + 1
                flag = True
            elif s[i] == ')':
                char = s[index:i]
                result += hash_map.get(char, '?')
                flag = False
            elif not flag:
                result += s[i]
        return result
```
