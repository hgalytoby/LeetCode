You are given an  `m x n`  binary matrix  `grid`.

A  **move**  consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all  `0`'s to  `1`'s, and all  `1`'s to  `0`'s).

Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the  **score**  of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return  _the highest possible  **score**  after making any number of  **moves**  (including zero moves)_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-toogle1.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
Explanation: 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 20`
-   `grid[i][j]`  is either  `0`  or  `1`.


### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def matrixScore(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        row, col = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for r in range(row):
            if grid[r][0] == 0:
                for c in range(col):
                    if grid[r][c] == 0:
                        grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        grid[r][c] = 0
        for c in range(col):
            count = sum(grid[r][c] == 0 for r in range(row))
            if count > row - count:
                for r in range(row):
                    if grid[r][c] == 0:
                        grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        grid[r][c] = 0
        return sum(int(''.join(map(str, grid[r])), 2) for r in range(row))
