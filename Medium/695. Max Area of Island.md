You are given an  `m x n`  binary matrix  `grid`. An island is a group of  `1`'s (representing land) connected  **4-directionally**  (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The  **area**  of an island is the number of cells with a value  `1`  in the island.

Return  _the maximum  **area**  of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return  `0`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
-   `grid[i][j]`  is either  `0`  or  `1`.


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(x, y):
            if m > x >= 0 and n > y >= 0 and grid[x][y] != 0:
                val = grid[x][y]
                grid[x][y] = 0
                val += dfs(x, y + 1)
                val += dfs(x, y - 1)
                val += dfs(x + 1, y)
                val += dfs(x - 1, y)
                return val
            return 0

        result = 0
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] != 0:
                    result = max(result, dfs(i, j))
        return result
