You are given two integers  `m`  and  `n`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.

You are also given the  `head`  of a linked list of integers.

Generate an  `m x n`  matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in  **spiral**  order  **(
clockwise)**, starting from the  **top-left**  of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with  `-1`.

Return  _the generated matrix_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/09/ex1new.jpg)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
Output: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/11/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]
Output: [[0,1,2,-1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.
The last space in the matrix is set to -1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `1 <= m * n <= 105`
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[1, m * n]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

        d = 0
        cur = [0, -1]
        nm = [n, m - 1]
        result = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        while head:
            x, y = direction[d]
            v_index = d % 2
            for i in range(nm[v_index]):
                if not head:
                    break
                cur[0] += x
                cur[1] += y
                result[cur[0]][cur[1]] = head.val
                head = head.next
            nm[v_index] -= 1
            d = (d + 1) % 4
        return result
