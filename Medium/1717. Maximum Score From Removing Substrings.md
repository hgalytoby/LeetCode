You are given a string  `s`  and two integers  `x`  and  `y`. You can perform two types of operations any number of
times.

- Remove substring  `"ab"`  and gain  `x`  points.
    - For example, when removing  `"ab"`  from  `"cabxbae"`  it becomes  `"cxbae"`.
- Remove substring  `"ba"`  and gain  `y`  points.
    - For example, when removing  `"ba"`  from  `"cabxbae"`  it becomes  `"cabxe"`.

Return  _the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on_  `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
Output: 20
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `1 <= x, y <= 104`
- `s`  consists of lowercase English letters.
