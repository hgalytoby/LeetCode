> Note: This is a companion problem to the  [System Design](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/)  problem:  [Design TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/).

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as  `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl`  and it returns a short URL such as  `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.

There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Implement the  `Solution`  class:

-   `Solution()`  Initializes the object of the system.
-   `String encode(String longUrl)`  Returns a tiny URL for the given  `longUrl`.
-   `String decode(String shortUrl)`  Returns the original long URL for the given  `shortUrl`. It is guaranteed that the given  `shortUrl`  was encoded by the same object.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
Output: "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
```

**Explanation:**
Solution obj = new Solution();
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after deconding it.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= url.length <= 104`
-   `url`  is guranteed to be a valid URL.


### Python
```python
import base64


class Codec:
    def __init__(self):
        self.show = {}
        self.long = {}
        self.baseURL = "http://tinyurl.com/"
    
    def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
        """Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        """
        if longUrl not in self.long:
            b64 = base64.b64encode(longUrl.encode('UTF-8'))[:10]
            self.show[b64] = longUrl
            self.long[longUrl] = b64
            return b64
        return self.long[longUrl]
        

    def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
        """Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        """
        return self.show[shortUrl]

    
# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
```
