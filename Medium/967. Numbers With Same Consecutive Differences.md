Return all  **non-negative**  integers of length  `n`  such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is  `k`.

Note that  **every**  number in the answer  **must not**  have leading zeros. For example,  `01`  has one leading zero and is invalid.

You may return the answer in  **any order**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, k = 7
Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 9`
-   `0 <= k <= 9`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numsSameConsecDiff(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        for i in range(n - 1):
            arr = []
            for num in nums:
                r = num % 10
                if r + k < 10:
                    arr.append(num * 10 + r + k)
                if k != 0 and r - k >= 0:
                    arr.append(num * 10 + r - k)
            nums = arr
        return nums
