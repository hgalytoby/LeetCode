You are given  `n × m`  grid and an integer  `k`.

A sensor placed on cell  `(r, c)`  covers all cells whose  **Chebyshev distance**  from  `(r, c)`  is  **at most**  `k`.

The  **Chebyshev distance**  between two cells  `(r1, c1)`  and  `(r2, c2)`  is  `max(|r1 − r2|,|c1 − c2|)`.

Your task is to return the  **minimum**  number of sensors required to cover every cell of the grid.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  n = 5, m = 5, k = 1
Output:  4
Explanation:
Placing sensors at positions  `(0, 3)`,  `(1, 0)`,  `(3, 3)`, and  `(4, 1)`  ensures every cell in the grid is covered. Thus, the answer is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  n = 2, m = 2, k = 2
Output:  1
Explanation:
With  `k = 2`, a single sensor can cover the entire  `2 * 2`  grid regardless of its position. Thus, the answer is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 103`
-   `1 <= m <= 103`
-   `0 <= k <= 103`
