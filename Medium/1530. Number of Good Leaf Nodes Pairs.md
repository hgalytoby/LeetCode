You are given the  `root`  of a binary tree and an integer  `distance`. A pair of two different  **leaf**  nodes of a
binary tree is said to be good if the length of  **the shortest path**  between them is less than or equal
to  `distance`.

Return  _the number of good leaf node pairs_  in the tree.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/e1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the shortest path between them is 3. This is the only good pair.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/e2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], distance = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The good pairs are [4,5] and [6,7] with shortest path = 2. The pair [4,6] is not good because the length of ther shortest path between them is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2], distance = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The only good pair is [2,5].
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the  `tree`  is in the range  `[1, 210].`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= distance <= 10`
