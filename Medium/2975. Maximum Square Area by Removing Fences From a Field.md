There is a large  `(m - 1) x (n - 1)`  rectangular field with corners at  `(1, 1)`  and  `(m, n)`  containing some horizontal and vertical fences given in arrays  `hFences`  and  `vFences`  respectively.

Horizontal fences are from the coordinates  `(hFences[i], 1)`  to  `(hFences[i], n)`  and vertical fences are from the coordinates  `(1, vFences[i])`  to  `(m, vFences[i])`.

Return  _the  **maximum**  area of a  **square**  field that can be formed by  **removing**  some fences (**possibly none**) or_ `-1`  _if it is impossible to make a square field_.

Since the answer may be large, return it  **modulo**  `109 + 7`.

**Note:** The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates  `(1, 1)`  to  `(1, n)`  and  `(m, 1)`  to  `(m, n)`  and two vertical fences from the coordinates  `(1, 1)`  to  `(m, 1)`  and  `(1, n)`  to  `(m, n)`. These fences  **cannot**  be removed.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/05/screenshot-from-2023-11-05-22-40-25.png)
```
Input: m = 4, n = 3, hFences = [2,3], vFences = [2]
Output: 4
Explanation: Removing the horizontal fence at 2 and the vertical fence at 2 will give a square field of area 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/22/maxsquareareaexample1.png)
```
Input: m = 6, n = 7, hFences = [2], vFences = [4]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proved that there is no way to create a square field by removing fences.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `3 <= m, n <= 109`
-   `1 <= hFences.length, vFences.length <= 600`
-   `1 < hFences[i] < m`
-   `1 < vFences[i] < n`
-   `hFences` and `vFences` are unique.

        for n in arr:
            for t in temp:
                result.add(abs(t - n))
            result.add(abs(1 - n))
            result.add(abs(n - limit))
            temp.append(n)
        return result

    def maximizeSquareArea(self, m: int, n: int, hFences: List[int], vFences: List[int]) -> int:
        arr = self.helper(m, hFences) & self.helper(n, vFences)
        return max(arr) ** 2 % self.MOD if arr else -1
