Implement  `atoi`  which converts a string to an integer.<br>

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.<br>

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.<br>

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.<br>

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.<br><br>

**Note:**

-   Only the space character  `' '`  is considered a whitespace character.
-   Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: str = "42"
Output: 42
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: str = "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign. Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: str = "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: str = "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: str = "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer. Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
-   `s`  consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits,  `' '`,  `'+'`,  `'-'`  and  `'.'`.
