You are given a string  `s`  and an integer  `k`.

Define a function  `distance(s1, s2)`  between two strings  `s1`  and  `s2`  of the same length  `n`  as:

-   The **sum**  of the  **minimum distance**  between  `s1[i]`  and  `s2[i]`  when the characters from  `'a'`  to  `'z'`  are placed in a  **cyclic**  order, for all  `i`  in the range  `[0, n - 1]`.

For example,  `distance("ab", "cd") == 4`, and  `distance("a", "z") == 1`.

You can  **change**  any letter of  `s`  to  **any**  other lowercase English letter,  **any**  number of times.

Return a string denoting the

lexicographically smallest

string  `t`  you can get after some changes, such that  `distance(s, t) <= k`.

**Example 1:**
```
**Input:**  s = "zbbz", k = 3
**Output:**  "aaaz"
**Explanation:**
```
Change  `s`  to  `"aaaz"`. The distance between  `"zbbz"`  and  `"aaaz"`  is equal to  `k = 3`.

**Example 2:**
```
**Input:**  s = "xaxcd", k = 4
**Output:**  "aawcd"
**Explanation:**
```

The distance between "xaxcd" and "aawcd" is equal to k = 4.

**Example 3:**
```
**Input:**  s = "lol", k = 0
**Output:**  "lol"
**Explanation:**
```

It's impossible to change any character as  `k = 0`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= k <= 2000`
-   `s`  consists only of lowercase English letters.

    def getSmallestString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        result = ''
        for c in s:
            cur = ord(c)
            l, r = cur - 97, 123 - cur
            n = min(l, r)
            if n <= k:
                k -= n
                result += 'a'
            else:
                result += chr(ord(c) - k)
                k = 0
        return result
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getSmallestString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        i, n, result = 0, len(s), ''
        table = ascii_lowercase + 'a'
        while k > 0 and i < n:
            l = r = ord(s[i]) - 97
            temp = k
            while temp > 0:
                if l <= 0:
                    break
                if r >= 26:
                    break
                temp -= 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1
            k = temp
            i += 1
            result += min(table[l], table[r])
        return result + s[len(result):]
