You are given a string  `s`. It may contain any number of  `'*'`  characters. Your task is to remove all  `'*'`
characters.

While there is a  `'*'`, do the following operation:

- Delete the leftmost  `'*'`  and the  **smallest**  non-`'*'`  character to its  _left_. If there are several smallest
  characters, you can delete any of them.

Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all  `'*'`  characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  s = "aaba*"
Output:  "aab"
Explanation:
We should delete one of the  `'a'`  characters with  `'*'`. If we choose  `s[3]`,  `s`  becomes the lexicographically smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  s = "abc"
Output:  "abc"
Explanation:
There is no  `'*'`  in the string.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s`  consists only of lowercase English letters and  `'*'`.
- The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all  `'*'`  characters.

    def clearStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        group = defaultdict(list)
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c == "*":
                key = min(group)
                group[key].pop()
                if not group[key]:
                    del group[key]
            else:
                group[c].append(i)
        arr = [(i, k) for k, v in group.items() for i in v]
        return ''.join(c for _, c in sorted(arr))
```

            if c == '*' and stack:
                heappop(stack)
            else:
                heappush(stack, (c, -i))
        return ''.join(c for c, _ in sorted(stack, key=lambda x: -x[1]))
```

                arr[i] = ""
                arr[-j] = ""
            else:
