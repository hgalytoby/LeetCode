You are given a string  `s`  and an integer  `repeatLimit`. Construct a new string  `repeatLimitedString`  using the
characters of  `s`  such that no letter appears  **more than**  `repeatLimit`  times  **in a row**. You do  **not**
have to use all characters from  `s`.

Return  _the  **lexicographically largest**_ `repeatLimitedString`  _possible_.

A string  `a`  is  **lexicographically larger**  than a string  `b`  if in the first position where  `a`  and  `b`
differ, string  `a`  has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in  `b`. If the
first  `min(a.length, b.length)`  characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "cczazcc", repeatLimit = 3
Output: "zzcccac"
Explanation: We use all of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "zzcccac".
The letter 'a' appears at most 1 time in a row.
The letter 'c' appears at most 3 times in a row.
The letter 'z' appears at most 2 times in a row.
Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "zzcccac".
Note that the string "zzcccca" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'c' appears more than 3 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aababab", repeatLimit = 2
Output: "bbabaa"
Explanation: We use only some of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "bbabaa". 
The letter 'a' appears at most 2 times in a row.
The letter 'b' appears at most 2 times in a row.
Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "bbabaa".
Note that the string "bbabaaa" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'a' appears more than 2 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= repeatLimit <= s.length <= 105`
- `s`  consists of lowercase English letters.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatLimitedString(self, s: str, repeatLimit: int) -> str:
        freq = [0] * 26
        for c in s:
            freq[ord(c) - 97] += 1
        cur_index = 25
        result = []
        while cur_index >= 0:
            if freq[cur_index] <= 0:
                cur_index -= 1
                continue
            used = min(freq[cur_index], repeatLimit)
            result.append(chr(97 + cur_index) * used)
            freq[cur_index] -= used
            if freq[cur_index] > 0:
                next_index = cur_index - 1
                while next_index >= 0 >= freq[next_index]:
                    next_index -= 1
                if next_index < 0:
                    break
                result.append(chr(97 + next_index))
                freq[next_index] -= 1
        return ''.join(result)
