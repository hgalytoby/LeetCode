You are given two integer arrays  `nums1`  and  `nums2`.

From  `nums1`  two elements have been removed, and all other elements have been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable  `x`.

As a result,  `nums1`  becomes  **equal**  to  `nums2`. Two arrays are considered  **equal**  when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.

Return the  **minimum**  possible integer  `x`  that achieves this equivalence.

**Example 1:**
```
**Input:**  nums1 = [4,20,16,12,8], nums2 = [14,18,10]
**Output:**  -2
**Explanation:**
```

After removing elements at indices  `[0,4]`  and adding -2,  `nums1`  becomes  `[18,14,10]`.

**Example 2:**
```
**Input:**  nums1 = [3,5,5,3], nums2 = [7,7]
**Output:**  2
**Explanation:**
```

After removing elements at indices  `[0,3]`  and adding 2,  `nums1`  becomes  `[7,7]`.

**Constraints:**

-   `3 <= nums1.length <= 200`
-   `nums2.length == nums1.length - 2`
-   `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
-   The test cases are generated in a way that there is an integer  `x`  such that  `nums1`  can become equal to  `nums2`  by removing two elements and adding  `x`  to each element of  `nums1`.

class Solution:
    def minimumAddedInteger(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        nums1.sort()
        nums2.sort()
        result, n = inf, len(nums1)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                index, diff = 0, None
                for x in range(n):
                    if x not in {i, j}:
                        v = nums2[index] - nums1[x]
                        if diff is None:
                            diff = v
                        elif diff != v:
                            break
                        index += 1
                else:
                    result = min(result, diff)
        return result
