A string  `s`  is called  **happy**  if it satisfies the following conditions:

- `s`  only contains the letters  `'a'`,  `'b'`, and  `'c'`.
- `s`  does not contain any of  `"aaa"`,  `"bbb"`, or  `"ccc"`  as a substring.
- `s`  contains  **at most**  `a`  occurrences of the letter  `'a'`.
- `s`  contains  **at most**  `b`  occurrences of the letter  `'b'`.
- `s`  contains  **at most**  `c`  occurrences of the letter  `'c'`.

Given three integers  `a`,  `b`, and  `c`, return  _the  **longest possible happy** string_. If there are multiple
longest happy strings, return  _any of them_. If there is no such string, return  _the empty string_ `""`.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 7
Output: "ccaccbcc"
Explanation: "ccbccacc" would also be a correct answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 7, b = 1, c = 0
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation: It is the only correct answer in this case.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= a, b, c <= 100`
- `a + b + c > 0`
