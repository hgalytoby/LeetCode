Given a binary tree  `root`, a node  _X_  in the tree is named **good**  if in the path from root to  _X_  there are no
nodes with a value  _greater than_  X.

Return the number of  **good**  nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png)**

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are **good**.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png)**

```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as **good**.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between  `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode, max_value: int = -math.inf) -> int:
        value = 0
        if not root:
            return value
        if root.val >= max_value:
            max_value = root.val
            value += 1
        l = self.goodNodes(root.left, max_value=max_value)
        r = self.goodNodes(root.right, max_value=max_value)
        return value + l + r
