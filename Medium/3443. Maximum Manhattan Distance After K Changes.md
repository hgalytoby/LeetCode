You are given a string  `s`  consisting of the characters  `'N'`,  `'S'`,  `'E'`, and  `'W'`, where  `s[i]`  indicates
movements in an infinite grid:

- `'N'`  : Move north by 1 unit.
- `'S'`  : Move south by 1 unit.
- `'E'`  : Move east by 1 unit.
- `'W'`  : Move west by 1 unit.

Initially, you are at the origin  `(0, 0)`. You can change  **at most**  `k`  characters to any of the four directions.

Find the  **maximum**  **Manhattan distance**  from the origin that can be achieved  **at any time**  while performing
the movements  **in order**.

The **Manhattan Distance** between two cells `(xi, yi)` and `(xj, yj)` is `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  s = "NWSE", k = 1
Output:  3
Explanation:
Change  `s[2]`  from  `'S'`  to  `'N'`. The string  `s`  becomes  `"NWNE"`.
Movement Position (x, y) Manhattan Distance Maximum
s[0] == 'N' (0, 1)  0 + 1 = 1 1
s[1] == 'W' (-1, 1) 1 + 1 = 2 2
s[2] == 'N' (-1, 2) 1 + 2 = 3 3
s[3] == 'E' (0, 2)  0 + 2 = 2 3
The maximum Manhattan distance from the origin that can be achieved is 3. Hence, 3 is the output.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  s = "NSWWEW", k = 3
Output:  6
Explanation:
Change  `s[1]`  from  `'S'`  to  `'N'`, and  `s[4]`  from  `'E'`  to  `'W'`. The string  `s`  becomes  `"NNWWWW"`.
The maximum Manhattan distance from the origin that can be achieved is 6. Hence, 6 is the output.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `0 <= k <= s.length`
- `s`  consists of only  `'N'`,  `'S'`,  `'E'`, and  `'W'`.

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        for d1 in 'N', 'S':
            for d2 in 'W', 'E':
                k_val = k
                max_v = cur = 0
                for c in s:
                    if c == d1 or c == d2:
                        cur += 1
                    elif k_val > 0:
                        k_val -= 1
                        cur += 1
                    else:
                        cur -= 1
                    max_v = max(max_v, cur)
                result = max(result, max_v)
        return result
```
