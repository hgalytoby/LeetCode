Given a string  `s`, find the length of the  **longest substring**  without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s`  consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        chars = ''
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in chars:
                chars += s[i]
            else:
                result = max(result, len(chars))
                chars = chars[chars.find(s[i]) + 1:] + s[i]
        return max(result, len(chars))
```

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            data = {s[i]}
            for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
                if s[j] in data:
                    break
                data.add(s[j])
            result = max(len(data), result)
        return result     
```
