Given an  `m x n`  2D binary grid  `grid`  which represents a map of  `'1'`s (land) and  `'0'`s (water), return  _the number of islands_.

An  **island**  is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
-   `grid[i][j]`  is  `'0'`  or  `'1'`.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: list[list[str]]) -> int:
        def is_island(r, c):
            grid[r][c] = '0'
            if r > 0 and grid[r - 1][c] == '1':
                is_island(r - 1, c)
            if r + 1 < m and grid[r + 1][c] == '1':
                is_island(r + 1, c)
            if c > 0 and grid[r][c - 1] == '1':
                is_island(r, c - 1)
            if c + 1 < n and grid[r][c + 1] == '1':
                is_island(r, c + 1)

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        result = 0
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == '1':
                    is_island(row, col)
                    result += 1
        return result
```
