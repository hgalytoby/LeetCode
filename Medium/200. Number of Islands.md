Given an  `m x n`  2D binary grid  `grid`  which represents a map of  `'1'`s (land) and  `'0'`s (water), return  _the number of islands_.

An  **island**  is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
-   `grid[i][j]`  is  `'0'`  or  `'1'`.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    self.is_lands(i=i, j=j, grid=grid)
                    result += 1
        return result

    def is_lands(self, i, j, grid):
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        grid[i][j] = '0'
        if i > 0 and grid[i - 1][j] == '1':
            self.is_lands(i=i - 1, j=j, grid=grid)
        if i + 1 < m and grid[i + 1][j] == '1':
            self.is_lands(i=i + 1, j=j, grid=grid)
        if j  > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == '1':
            self.is_lands(i=i, j=j - 1, grid=grid)
        if j + 1 < n and grid[i][j + 1] == '1':
            self.is_lands(i=i, j=j + 1, grid=grid)
