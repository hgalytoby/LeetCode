You are given a  **0-indexed**  integer array  `nums`  and an integer  `x`.

Find the  **minimum absolute difference**  between two elements in the array that are at least  `x`  indices apart.

In other words, find two indices  `i`  and  `j`  such that  `abs(i - j) >= x`  and  `abs(nums[i] - nums[j])`  is
minimized.

Return _an integer denoting the  **minimum**  absolute difference between two elements that are at least_  `x`  _indices
apart_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,4], x = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: We can select nums[0] = 4 and nums[3] = 4. 
They are at least 2 indices apart, and their absolute difference is the minimum, 0. 
It can be shown that 0 is the optimal answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,3,2,10,15], x = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: We can select nums[1] = 3 and nums[2] = 2.
They are at least 1 index apart, and their absolute difference is the minimum, 1.
It can be shown that 1 is the optimal answer.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], x = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We can select nums[0] = 1 and nums[3] = 4.
They are at least 3 indices apart, and their absolute difference is the minimum, 3.
It can be shown that 3 is the optimal answer.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= x < nums.length`
