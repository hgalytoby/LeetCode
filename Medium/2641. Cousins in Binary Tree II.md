Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the  **sum of all its cousins' values**.

Two nodes of a binary tree are  **cousins**  if they have the same depth with different parents.

Return  _the_ `root` _of the modified tree_.

**Note**  that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
Output: [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/11/diagram33.png)
```
Input: root = [3,1,2]
Output: [0,0,0]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 3 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 2 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 105]`.
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 104`
