There is an undirected tree with  `n`  nodes labeled from  `0`  to  `n - 1`, rooted at node  `0`. You are given a 2D
integer array  `edges`  of length  `n - 1`  where  `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`  indicates that there is an edge between
nodes  `ai`  and  `bi`  in the tree.

At every node  `i`, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers  `amount`, where  `amount[i]`
represents:

- the price needed to open the gate at node  `i`, if  `amount[i]`  is negative, or,
- the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node  `i`, otherwise.

The game goes on as follows:

- Initially, Alice is at node  `0`  and Bob is at node  `bob`.
- At every second, Alice and Bob  **each**  move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some  **leaf node**, while Bob
  moves towards node  `0`.
- For  **every**  node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the
  reward. Note that:
    - If the gate is  **already open**, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
    - If Alice and Bob reach the node  **simultaneously**, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In
      other words, if the price to open the gate is  `c`, then both Alice and Bob pay `c / 2`  each. Similarly, if the
      reward at the gate is  `c`, both of them receive  `c / 2`  each.
- If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node  `0`, he stops moving. Note that these
  events are  **independent**  of each other.

Return _the  **maximum**  net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/29/eg1.png)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.
```

**Example 2:**

```
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/29/eg2.png)

Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. 
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- `edges`  represents a valid tree.
- `1 <= bob < n`
- `amount.length == n`
- `amount[i]`  is an  **even**  integer in the range  `[-104, 104]`.
