There is an undirected tree with  `n`  nodes labeled from  `0`  to  `n - 1`  and  `n - 1`  edges.

You are given a 2D integer array  `edges`  of length  `n - 1`  where  `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`  indicates that there is an edge between nodes  `ai`  and  `bi`  in the tree. You are also given an integer array  `restricted`  which represents  **restricted**  nodes.

Return  _the  **maximum**  number of nodes you can reach from node_ `0` _without visiting a restricted node._

Note that node  `0`  will  **not**  be a restricted node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/15/ex1drawio.png)
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
We have that [0,1,2,3] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/15/ex2drawio.png)
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,5],[0,4],[3,2],[6,5]], restricted = [4,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
We have that [0,5,6] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 105`
-   `edges.length == n - 1`
-   `edges[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
-   `ai != bi`
-   `edges`  represents a valid tree.
-   `1 <= restricted.length < n`
-   `1 <= restricted[i] < n`
-   All the values of  `restricted`  are  **unique**.
