You are given an integer  `n`  and an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with  `n`  nodes numbered from 0 to  `n - 1`.
This is represented by a 2D array  `edges`  of length  `n - 1`, where  `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`  indicates an edge from
node  `ui`  to  `vi`  .

Each node  `i`  has an associated cost given by  `cost[i]`, representing the cost to traverse that node.

The  **score**  of a path is defined as the sum of the costs of all nodes along the path.

Your goal is to make the scores of all  **root-to-leaf**  paths  **equal**  by  **increasing**  the cost of any number
of nodes by  **any non-negative**  amount.

Return the  **minimum**  number of nodes whose cost must be increased to make all root-to-leaf path scores equal.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], cost = [2,1,3]
Output:  1

There are two root-to-leaf paths:

-   Path  `0 → 1`  has a score of  `2 + 1 = 3`.
-   Path  `0 → 2`  has a score of  `2 + 3 = 5`.

To make all root-to-leaf path scores equal to 5, increase the cost of node 1 by 2.  
Only one node is increased, so the output is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], cost = [5,1,4]
Output:  0
Explanation:

There is only  one root-to-leaf path:
-   Path  `0 → 1 → 2`  has a score of  `5 + 1 + 4 = 10`.
Since only one root-to-leaf path exists, all path costs are trivially equal, and the output is 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:  n = 5, edges = [[0,4],[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]], cost = [3,4,1,1,7]
Output:  1
Explanation:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/05/28/screenshot-2025-05-28-at-135704.png)
There are three root-to-leaf paths:
-   Path  `0 → 4`  has a score of  `3 + 7 = 10`.
-   Path  `0 → 1 → 2`  has a score of  `3 + 4 + 1 = 8`.
-   Path  `0 → 1 → 3`  has a score of  `3 + 4 + 1 = 8`.
To make all root-to-leaf path scores equal to 10, increase the cost of node 1 by 2. Thus, the output is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
- `cost.length == n`
- `1 <= cost[i] <= 109`
- The input is generated such that  `edges`  represents a valid tree.

```py
class Solution:
    def minIncrease(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        def dfs(cur):
            if cur in counter:
                return counter[cur]
            nonlocal result
            total = cost[cur]
            max_v = 0
            values = []
            for child in graph[cur]:
                child_val = dfs(child)
                max_v = max(max_v, child_val)
                values.append(child_val)
            result += sum(max_v != value for value in values)
            counter[cur] = total + max_v
            return counter[cur]

        counter = Counter()
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in edges:
            graph[min(a, b)].append(max(a, b))

        result = 0
        dfs(0)
        return result
