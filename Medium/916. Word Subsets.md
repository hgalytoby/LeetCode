You are given two string arrays  `words1`  and  `words2`.

A string  `b`  is a  **subset**  of string  `a`  if every letter in  `b`  occurs in  `a`  including multiplicity.

-   For example,  `"wrr"`  is a subset of  `"warrior"`  but is not a subset of  `"world"`.

A string  `a`  from  `words1`  is  **universal**  if for every string  `b`  in  `words2`,  `b`  is a subset of  `a`.

Return an array of all the  **universal**  strings in  `words1`. You may return the answer in  **any order**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 104`
-   `1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10`
-   `words1[i]`  and  `words2[i]`  consist only of lowercase English letters.
-   All the strings of  `words1`  are  **unique**.
