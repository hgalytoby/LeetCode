You are given a  **0-indexed**  array  `nums`  consisting of  **positive**  integers. You can choose two indices  `i`
and  `j`, such that  `i != j`, and the sum of digits of the number  `nums[i]`  is equal to that of  `nums[j]`.

Return  _the  **maximum**  value of_ `nums[i] + nums[j]` _that you can obtain over all possible indices_ `i` _and_ `j`
_that satisfy the conditions._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
Output: 54
Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
- (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
- (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        group = defaultdict(list)
        for num in nums:
            heappush(group[sum(map(int, str(num)))], -num)
        result = -1
        for value in group.values():
            if len(value) <= 1:
                continue
            v1, v2 = heappop(value), heappop(value)
            result = max(result, -(v1 + v2))
        return result
```
