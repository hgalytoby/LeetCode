Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, construct a  **0-indexed**  `m x n`  string matrix  `res`  that represents a  *
*formatted layout**  of the tree. The formatted layout matrix should be constructed using the following rules:

- The  **height**  of the tree is  `height` and the number of rows  `m`  should be equal to  `height + 1`.
- The number of columns  `n`  should be equal to  `2height+1 - 1`.
- Place the  **root node**  in the  **middle**  of the  **top row**  (more formally, at location  `res[0][(n-1)/2]`).
- For each node that has been placed in the matrix at position  `res[r][c]`, place its  **left child**
  at  `res[r+1][c-2height-r-1]`  and its  **right child**  at  `res[r+1][c+2height-r-1]`.
- Continue this process until all the nodes in the tree have been placed.
- Any empty cells should contain the empty string  `""`.

Return  _the constructed matrix_ `res`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 
[["","1",""],
 ["2","",""]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: 
[["","","","1","","",""],
 ["","2","","","","3",""],
 ["","","4","","","",""]]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 210]`.
- `-99 <= Node.val <= 99`
- The depth of the tree will be in the range  `[1, 10]`.

                result[i][j] = items[i][index]
