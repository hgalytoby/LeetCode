You are given an array of strings  `arr`. A string  `s`  is formed by the  **concatenation**  of a  **subsequence**  of  `arr`  that has  **unique characters**.

Return  _the  **maximum**  possible length_  of  `s`.

A  **subsequence**  is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**
```
**Input:** arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
**Input:** arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers").
```

**Example 3:**
```
**Input:** arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
**Output:** 26
**Explanation:** The only string in arr has all 26 characters.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= arr.length <= 16`
-   `1 <= arr[i].length <= 26`
-   `arr[i]`  contains only lowercase English letters.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:
        result = [set()]
        for char in arr:
            c = set(char)
            if len(char) != len(c):
                continue
            for r in result:
                if not (r & c):
                    result.append(r | c)
        return len(max(result, key=len))
```
