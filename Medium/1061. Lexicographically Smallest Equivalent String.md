You are given two strings of the same length  `s1`  and  `s2`  and a string  `baseStr`.

We say  `s1[i]`  and  `s2[i]`  are equivalent characters.

- For example, if  `s1 = "abc"`  and  `s2 = "cde"`, then we have  `'a' == 'c'`,  `'b' == 'd'`, and  `'c' == 'e'`.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

- **Reflexivity:**  `'a' == 'a'`.
- **Symmetry:**  `'a' == 'b'`  implies  `'b' == 'a'`.
- **Transitivity:**  `'a' == 'b'`  and  `'b' == 'c'`  implies  `'a' == 'c'`.

For example, given the equivalency information from  `s1 = "abc"`  and  `s2 = "cde"`,  `"acd"`  and  `"aab"`  are
equivalent strings of  `baseStr = "eed"`, and  `"aab"`  is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string
of  `baseStr`.

Return  _the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of_ `baseStr` _by using the equivalency information from_ `s1`
_and_ `s2`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
Output: "makkek"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is "makkek".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"
Output: "hdld"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is "hdld".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "programs", baseStr = "sourcecode"
Output: "aauaaaaada"
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is "aauaaaaada".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length, baseStr <= 1000`
- `s1.length == s2.length`
- `s1`,  `s2`, and  `baseStr`  consist of lowercase English letters.

```python

        index = 0
        group, char_index = {}, {}
        for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):
            if c1 == c2:
                continue
            if c1 not in char_index and c2 not in char_index:
                char_index[c1] = index
                char_index[c2] = index
                group[index] = [c1, c2]
                index += 1
            elif c1 not in char_index:
                i = char_index[c2]
                char_index[c1] = i

                for char in group[char_index[c2]]:
                    group[i].append(char)
                    char_index[char] = i
        for v in group.values():
            v.sort()
        return "".join(
            group[char_index[string]][0] if string in char_index else string
            for string in baseStr
        )
