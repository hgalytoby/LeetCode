You are given two integers  `m`  and  `n`  representing a  **0-indexed**  `m x n`  grid. You are also given two 2D
integer arrays  `guards`  and  `walls`  where  `guards[i] = [rowi, coli]`  and  `walls[j] = [rowj, colj]`  represent the
positions of the  `ith`  guard and  `jth`  wall respectively.

A guard can see  **every**  cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their
position unless  **obstructed**  by a wall or another guard. A cell is  **guarded**  if there is  **at least**  one
guard that can see it.

Return _the number of unoccupied cells that are  **not**  **guarded**._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/example1drawio2.png)

```
Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/example2drawio.png)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `2 <= m * n <= 105`
- `1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 104`
- `2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n`
- `guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2`
- `0 <= rowi, rowj < m`
- `0 <= coli, colj < n`
- All the positions in  `guards`  and  `walls`  are  **unique**.

```py

        def helper(x, y, step):

                if grid[i][col] == 0:
                    grid[i][col] = 1

        grid = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for row, col in walls:
            grid[row][col] = 2
        for row, col in guards:
            grid[row][col] = 2
        for row, col in guards:
            for r in range(row - 1, -1, -1):
                if grid[r][col] == 2:

            for r in range(row + 1, m):
                if grid[r][col] == 2:
                    break
                if grid[r][col] == 0:

            for c in range(col + 1, n):
                if grid[row][c] == 2:
                    break
                if grid[row][c] == 0:
                    grid[row][c] = 1
        result = sum(grid[row].count(0) for row in range(m))
        return result
