On a social network consisting of  `m`  users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer  `n`, an array  `languages`, and an array  `friendships`  where:

-   There are  `n`  languages numbered  `1`  through  `n`,
-   `languages[i]`  is the set of languages the  `ith`​​​​ user knows, and
-   `friendships[i] = [ui, vi]`  denotes a friendship between the users  `ui` and  `vi`.

You can choose  **one**  language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return  _the_  _**minimum**_ _number of users you need to teach._

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if `x` is a friend of `y` and `y` is a friend of `z`, this doesn't guarantee that `x` is a friend of `z`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2, languages = [[1],[2],[1,2]], friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, languages = [[2],[1,3],[1,2],[3]], friendships = [[1,4],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 500`
-   `languages.length == m`
-   `1 <= m <= 500`
-   `1 <= languages[i].length <= n`
-   `1 <= languages[i][j] <= n`
-   `1 <= ui < vi <= languages.length`
-   `1 <= friendships.length <= 500`
-   All tuples  `(ui, vi)`  are unique
-   `languages[i]`  contains only unique values

    def minimumTeachings(self, n: int, languages: List[List[int]], friendships: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        language_set_list = [set(language) for language in languages]
        cannot_communicate = set()
        for u, v in friendships:
            if language_set_list[u - 1].isdisjoint(language_set_list[v - 1]):
                cannot_communicate.add(u)
                cannot_communicate.add(v)
        language_count = Counter()
        for user in cannot_communicate:
            for language in languages[user - 1]:
                language_count[language] += 1
        return len(cannot_communicate) - max(language_count.values(), default=0)
```

            count = sum(1 for u in users if u in cannot_communicate)
            max_known = max(max_known, count)
