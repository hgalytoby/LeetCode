You are given a positive integer  `n`, representing an  `n x n`  city. You are also given a 2D grid  `buildings`, where  `buildings[i] = [x, y]`  denotes a  **unique**  building located at coordinates  `[x, y]`.

A building is  **covered**  if there is at least one building in all  **four**  directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of  **covered**  buildings.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
Output:  1
Explanation:
-   Only building  `[2,2]`  is covered as it has at least one building:
    -   above (`[1,2]`)
    -   below (`[3,2]`)
    -   left (`[2,1]`)
    -   right (`[2,3]`)
-   Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/04/telegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6212982906394101086-m.jpg)
```
Input:  n = 3, buildings = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output:  0
Explanation:
-   No building has at least one building in all four directions.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/16/telegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6248862251436067566-x.jpg)
```
Input:  n = 5, buildings = [[1,3],[3,2],[3,3],[3,5],[5,3]]
Output:  1
Explanation:
-   Only building  `[3,3]`  is covered as it has at least one building:
    -   above (`[1,3]`)
    -   below (`[5,3]`)
    -   left (`[3,2]`)
    -   right (`[3,5]`)
-   Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 105`
-   `1 <= buildings.length <= 105`
-   `buildings[i] = [x, y]`
-   `1 <= x, y <= n`
-   All coordinates of  `buildings`  are  **unique**.

### Python
```py
class Solution:
    def countCoveredBuildings(self, n: int, buildings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        row, col = {}, {}
        result = 0
        for x, y in buildings:
            if x not in row:
                row[x] = [y, y]
            else:
                row[x][0] = min(row[x][0], y)
                row[x][1] = max(row[x][1], y)
            if y not in col:
                col[y] = [x, x]
            else:
                col[y][0] = min(col[y][0], x)
                col[y][1] = max(col[y][1], x)
        for x, y in buildings:
            min_v1, max_v1 = row[x]
            min_v2, max_v2 = col[y]
            if min_v1 < y < max_v1 and min_v2 < x < max_v2:
                result += 1
        return result
