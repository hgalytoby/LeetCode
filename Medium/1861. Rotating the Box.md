You are given an  `m x n`  matrix of characters  `box`  representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one
of the following:

- A stone  `'#'`
- A stationary obstacle  `'*'`
- Empty  `'.'`

The box is rotated  **90 degrees clockwise**, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down
until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity  **does not**  affect the obstacles'
positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation  **does not** affect the stones' horizontal positions.

It is  **guaranteed**  that each stone in  `box`  rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

Return  _an_ `n x m` _matrix representing the box after the rotation described above_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: box = [["#",".","#"]]
Output: [["."],
         ["#"],
         ["#"]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode2withstones.png)

```
Input: box = [["#",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","*","."]]
Output: [["#","."],
         ["#","#"],
         ["*","*"],
         [".","."]]
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode3withstone.png)

```
Input: box = [["#","#","*",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
              ["#","#","#",".","#","."]]
Output: [[".","#","#"],
         [".","#","#"],
         ["#","#","*"],
         ["#","*","."],
         ["#",".","*"],
         ["#",".","."]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == box.length`
- `n == box[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `box[i][j]`  is either  `'#'`,  `'*'`, or  `'.'`.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    stop = {'.', '*'}

    def rotateTheBox(self, box: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        m, n = len(box), len(box[0])
        for r in range(m):
            for c in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if box[r][c] in self.stop:
                    continue
                prev, cur = c, c + 1
                while cur < n and box[r][cur] == '.':
                    box[r][cur] = '#'
                    box[r][prev] = '.'
                    prev = cur
                    cur += 1
        result = [[box[c][r] for c in range(m - 1, -1, -1)] for r in range(n)]
        return result
```
