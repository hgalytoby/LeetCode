Given an array of strings  `nums`  containing  `n`  **unique**  binary strings each of length  `n`, return  _a binary
string of length_ `n` _that  **does not appear**  in_ `nums`_. If there are multiple answers, you may return  **any**
of them_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = ["111","011","001"]
Output: "101"
Explanation: "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 16`
- `nums[i].length == n`
- `nums[i]` is either  `'0'`  or  `'1'`.
- All the strings of  `nums`  are  **unique**.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        items, n = set(nums), len(nums)
        return next(bin(i)[2:].zfill(n) for i in range(n + 1) if bin(i)[2:].zfill(n) not in items)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        items, n = set(nums), len(nums)
        for i in range(n + 1):
            v = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
            if v not in items:
                return v
```

```py
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        n = len(nums)
        queue = deque(["0", "1"])
        while queue:
            cur = queue.popleft()
            if len(cur) == n and cur not in nums_set:
                return cur
            queue.append(cur + "0")
            queue.append(cur + "1")
```
