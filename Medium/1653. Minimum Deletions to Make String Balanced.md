You are given a string  `s`  consisting only of characters  `'a'`  and  `'b'`.

You can delete any number of characters in  `s`  to make  `s`  **balanced**.  `s`  is  **balanced**  if there is no pair of indices  `(i,j)`  such that  `i < j`  and  `s[i] = 'b'`  and  `s[j]= 'a'`.

Return  _the  **minimum**  number of deletions needed to make_ `s` _**balanced**_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s[i]`  is `'a'`  or  `'b'`.

                a_count -= 1
            result = min(result, a_count + b_count)
            if s[i] == 'b':
                b_count += 1
        return result
