You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of  `order`  are  **unique**  and were sorted in some custom
order previously.

Permute the characters of  `s`  so that they match the order that  `order`  was sorted. More specifically, if a
character  `x`  occurs before a character  `y`  in  `order`, then  `x`  should occur before  `y`  in the permuted
string.

Return  _any permutation of_ `s` _that satisfies this property_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: order = "cbafg", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= order.length <= 26`
- `1 <= s.length <= 200`
- `order`  and  `s`  consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the characters of  `order`  are  **unique**.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        counter, result = Counter(s), ''
        for x in order:
            if x in counter:
                result += x * counter[x]
                counter[x] = 0
        for k, v in counter.items():
            if v != 0:
                result += k * v
        return result
```

```python
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        visited = set()
        counter = Counter(s)
        result = ''
        for char in order:
            if char in counter:
                result += char * counter[char]
                visited.add(char)
        for char in ascii_lowercase:
            if char in counter and char not in visited:
                result += char * counter[char]
        return result
```
