You are given a string  `s`  consisting of lowercase English words, each separated by a single space.

Determine how many vowels appear in the  **first**  word. Then, reverse each following word that has the  **same vowel count**. Leave all remaining words unchanged.

Return the resulting string.

Vowels are  `'a'`,  `'e'`,  `'i'`,  `'o'`, and  `'u'`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  s = "cat and mice"
Output:  "cat dna mice"
Explanation:
-   The first word  `"cat"`  has 1 vowel.
-   `"and"`  has 1 vowel, so it is reversed to form  `"dna"`.
-   `"mice"`  has 2 vowels, so it remains unchanged.
-   Thus, the resulting string is  `"cat dna mice"`.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  s = "book is nice"
Output:  "book is ecin"
Explanation:
-   The first word  `"book"`  has 2 vowels.
-   `"is"`  has 1 vowel, so it remains unchanged.
-   `"nice"`  has 2 vowels, so it is reversed to form  `"ecin"`.
-   Thus, the resulting string is  `"book is ecin"`.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input:  s = "banana healthy"
Output:  "banana healthy"
Explanation:
-   The first word  `"banana"`  has 3 vowels.
-   `"healthy"`  has 2 vowels, so it remains unchanged.
-   Thus, the resulting string is  `"banana healthy"`.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s`  consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
-   Words in  `s`  are separated by a  **single**  space.
-   `s`  does  **not**  contain leading or trailing spaces.


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"}

    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        arr = s.split(' ')
        n = len(arr)
        vowel_count = sum(c in self.vowels for c in arr[0])
        for i in range(1, n):
            if sum(c in self.vowels for c in arr[i]) == vowel_count:
                arr[i] = arr[i][::-1]
        return ' '.join(arr)
