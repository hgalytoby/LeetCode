You are given an integer array  `nums`  and an integer  `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals  `k`  and remove them from the array.

Return  _the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
-   `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
-   `1 <= k <= 109`


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        data = {}
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            data[num] = data.get(num, 0) + 1
        for key in data:
            target = k - key
            if target in data:
                while True:
                    if target == key and data[key] > 1:
                        data[key] -= 2
                        result += 1
                    elif target != key and data[key] > 0 and data[target] > 0:
                        data[key] -= 1
                        data[target] -= 1
                        result += 1
                    else:
                        break
        return result
```
