On day  `1`, one person discovers a secret.

You are given an integer  `delay`, which means that each person will  **share**  the secret with a new person  **every day**, starting from  `delay`  days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer  `forget`, which means that each person will  **forget**  the secret  `forget`  days after discovering it. A person  **cannot**  share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.

Given an integer  `n`, return _the number of people who know the secret at the end of day_ `n`. Since the answer may be very large, return it  **modulo**  `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 6, delay = 2, forget = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
Day 1: Suppose the first person is named A. (1 person)
Day 2: A is the only person who knows the secret. (1 person)
Day 3: A shares the secret with a new person, B. (2 people)
Day 4: A shares the secret with a new person, C. (3 people)
Day 5: A forgets the secret, and B shares the secret with a new person, D. (3 people)
Day 6: B shares the secret with E, and C shares the secret with F. (5 people)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4, delay = 1, forget = 3
Output: 6
Explanation:
Day 1: The first person is named A. (1 person)
Day 2: A shares the secret with B. (2 people)
Day 3: A and B share the secret with 2 new people, C and D. (4 people)
Day 4: A forgets the secret. B, C, and D share the secret with 3 new people. (6 people)
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 1000`
-   `1 <= delay < forget <= n`


### Python
```py
class Solution:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    def peopleAwareOfSecret(self, n: int, delay: int, forget: int) -> int:
        know_queue, share_queue = deque([[1, 1]]), deque([])
        know_count, share_count = 1, 0
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            if know_queue and i >= know_queue[0][0] + delay:
                know_count -= know_queue[0][1]
                share_count += know_queue[0][1]
                share_queue.append(know_queue.popleft())
            if share_queue and i >= share_queue[0][0] + forget:
                _, count = share_queue.popleft()
                share_count -= count
            if share_queue:
                know_count += share_count
                know_queue.append([i, share_count])
        return (know_count + share_count) % self.MOD
