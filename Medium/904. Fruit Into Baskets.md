You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by
an integer array  `fruits`  where  `fruits[i]`  is the  **type**  of fruit the  `ith`  tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have  **two**  baskets, and each basket can only hold a  **single type**  of fruit. There is no limit on the
  amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick  **exactly one fruit**  from  **every**  tree (including the
  start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array  `fruits`, return  _the  **maximum**  number of fruits you can pick_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`
- `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        items = [[fruits[0], 1]]
        for i in range(1, len(fruits)):
            if items[-1][0] == fruits[i]:
                items[-1][1] += 1
            else:
                items.append([fruits[i], 1])
        result = items[-1][1]
        skip = set()
        for i in range(1, len(items)):
            k = tuple([items[i - 1][0], items[i][0]])
            if k in skip:
                continue
            skip.add(k)
            left = i - 2
            right = i + 1
            lv = rv = 0
            while left >= 0 and items[left][0] in k:
                lv += items[left][1]
                left -= 1
            while right < len(items) and items[right][0] in k:
                rv += items[right][1]
                right += 1
            result = max(result, items[i - 1][1] + items[i][1] + rv + lv)
        return result
```
