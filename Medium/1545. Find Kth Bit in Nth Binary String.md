Given two positive integers  `n`  and  `k`, the binary string  `Sn`  is formed as follows:

- `S1 = "0"`
- `Si = Si - 1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Si - 1))`  for  `i > 1`

Where  `+`  denotes the concatenation operation,  `reverse(x)`  returns the reversed string  `x`, and  `invert(x)`
inverts all the bits in  `x`  (`0`  changes to  `1`  and  `1`  changes to  `0`).

For example, the first four strings in the above sequence are:

- `S1 = "0"`
- `S2 = "0**1**1"`
- `S3 = "011**1**001"`
- `S4 = "0111001**1**0110001"`

Return  _the_  `kth`  _bit_  _in_  `Sn`. It is guaranteed that  `k`  is valid for the given  `n`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "0"
Explanation: S3 is "**0**111001".
The 1st bit is "0".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, k = 11
Output: "1"
Explanation: S4 is "0111001101**1**0001".
The 11th bit is "1".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= k <= 2n - 1`

### Python

```py
class Solution:
    def findKthBit(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        cur = "0"
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k <= len(cur):
                break
            cur += "1"
            cur += "".join("1" if c == "0" else "0" for c in cur[:-1])[::-1]
        return cur[k - 1]
```
