Given a  **0-indexed**  2D  `grid`  of size  `m x n`, you should find the matrix  `answer`  of size  `m x n`.

The value of each cell  `(r, c)`  of the matrix  `answer`  is calculated in the following way:

- Let  `topLeft[r][c]`  be the number of  **distinct**  values in the top-left diagonal of the cell  `(r, c)`  in the
  matrix  `grid`.
- Let  `bottomRight[r][c]`  be the number of  **distinct**  values in the bottom-right diagonal of the cell  `(r, c)`
  in the matrix  `grid`.

Then  `answer[r][c] = |topLeft[r][c] - bottomRight[r][c]|`.

Return  _the matrix_  `answer`.

A  **matrix diagonal**  is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column
and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end.

A cell  `(r1, c1)`  belongs to the top-left diagonal of the cell  `(r, c)`, if both belong to the same diagonal
and  `r1 < r`. Similarly is defined bottom-right diagonal.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[3,1,5],[3,2,1]]
Output: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]
Explanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial grid. 
The 2nd diagram denotes a grid for cell (0,0), where blue-colored cells are cells on its bottom-right diagonal.
The 3rd diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,2), where red-colored cells are cells on its top-left diagonal.
The 4th diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,1), where blue-colored cells are cells on its bottom-right diagonal and red-colored cells are cells on its top-left diagonal.
- The cell (0,0) contains [1,1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 0| = 1.
- The cell (1,2) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and [2] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 1| = 1.
- The cell (1,1) contains [1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [1] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 1| = 0.
The answers of other cells are similarly calculated.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: [[0]]
Explanation: - The cell (0,0) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and [] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 0| = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n, grid[i][j] <= 50`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def differenceOfDistinctValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(m):
            arr = []
            for j in range(n):
                top_left = set()
                r, c = i, j
                while 0 < r and 0 < c:
                    r -= 1
                    c -= 1
                    top_left.add(grid[r][c])
                r, c = i, j
                bottom_right = set()
                while r + 1 < m and c + 1 < n:
                    r += 1
                    c += 1
                    bottom_right.add(grid[r][c])
                arr.append(abs(len(top_left) - len(bottom_right)))
            result.append(arr)
        return result
