You are given an integer  `n`. There is a  **complete binary tree**  with  `2n - 1`  nodes. The root of that tree is the
node with the value  `1`, and every node with a value  `val`  in the range  `[1, 2n - 1 - 1]`  has two children where:

- The left node has the value  `2 * val`, and
- The right node has the value  `2 * val + 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array  `queries`  of length  `m`, where  `queries[i] = [ai, bi]`. For each query, solve
the following problem:

1. Add an edge between the nodes with values  `ai`  and  `bi`.
2. Find the length of the cycle in the graph.
3. Remove the added edge between nodes with values  `ai`  and  `bi`.

**Note**  that:

- A  **cycle**  is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
- The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.
- There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.

Return  _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `m` _where_  `answer[i]`  _is the answer to the_  `ith`  _query._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/25/bexample1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, queries = [[5,3],[4,7],[2,3]]
Output: [4,5,3]
Explanation: The diagrams above show the tree of 23 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 3 and 5, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [5,2,1,3]. Thus answer to the first query is 4. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 4 and 7, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [4,2,1,3,7]. Thus answer to the second query is 5. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 2 and 3, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1,3]. Thus answer to the third query is 3. We delete the added edge.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/25/aexample2.png)

```
Input: n = 2, queries = [[1,2]]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree of 22 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 1 and 2, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1]. Thus answer for the first query is 2. We delete the added edge.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 30`
- `m == queries.length`
- `1 <= m <= 105`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai, bi <= 2n - 1`
- `ai != bi`

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def cycleLengthQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        for left, right in queries:
            count = 1
            while left != right:
                if left > right:
                    left //= 2
                else:
                    right //= 2
                count += 1
            result.append(count)
        return result

```
