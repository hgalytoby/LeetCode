Given a string  `s`  representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return  _the result of the evaluation_.

**Note:**  You are  **not**  allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as  `eval()`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
-   `s`  consists of digits,  `'+'`,  `'-'`,  `'('`,  `')'`, and  `' '`.
-   `s`  represents a valid expression.
-   `'+'`  is  **not**  used as a unary operation (i.e.,  `"+1"`  and  `"+(2 + 3)"`  is invalid).
-   `'-'`  could be used as a unary operation (i.e.,  `"-1"`  and  `"-(2 + 3)"`  is valid).
-   There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
-   Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    calculate_sign = {'-': -1, '+': 1}

    def sum_num(self, s):
        s = s.replace('--', '+').replace('+-', '-')
        calculate, nums, result = '+', '0', 0
        for n in s:
            if n.isdigit():
                nums += n
            else:
                result += self.calculate_sign[calculate] * int(nums)
                calculate = n
                nums = '0'
        result += self.calculate_sign[calculate] * int(nums)
        return result

    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = s.replace(' ', '')
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i] == ')':
                j = i - 1
                while s[j] != '(':
                    j -= 1
                temp = s[j + 1:i]
                s = s.replace(f'({temp})', str(self.sum_num(s=temp)))
                i -= (2 + len(temp))
            i += 1
        return self.sum_num(s)
```
