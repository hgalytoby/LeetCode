Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored
in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or
another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a
string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:**  The input/output format is the same
as  [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-).
You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[0, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

### Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not root:
            return ''
        nodes = deque([root])
        result = []
        while nodes:
            node = nodes.popleft()
            if node:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                nodes.append(node.left)
                nodes.append(node.right)
            else:
                result.append('None')
        return ','.join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not data:
            return
        nodes = data.split(',')
        tree = TreeNode(int(nodes[0]))
        queue = deque([tree])
        i = 1
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if nodes[i] != 'None':
                current.left = TreeNode(nodes[i])
                queue.append(current.left)
            i += 1
            if nodes[i] != 'None':
                current.right = TreeNode(nodes[i])
                queue.append(current.right)
            i += 1
        return tree

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# ser = Codec()
# deser = Codec()
# ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root))
