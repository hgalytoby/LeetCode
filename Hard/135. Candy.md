There are  `n`  children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array  `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

-   Each child must have at least one candy.
-   Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return  _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`

### Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        items = sorted(enumerate(ratings), key=lambda x: x[1])
        arr = [1] * len(ratings)
        n = len(ratings)
        for i in range(1, n):
            index, value = items[i]
            prev_index = index - 1
            next_index = index + 1
            if prev_index >= 0 and value > ratings[prev_index]:
                prev_v = arr[prev_index]
            else:
                prev_v = 0
            if next_index < n and value > ratings[next_index]:
                next_v = arr[next_index]
            else:
                next_v = 0
            arr[index] = max(prev_v, next_v) + 1
        return sum(arr)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        l = [1 for i in range(n)]
        r = l.copy()
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                l[i] = l[i - 1] + 1
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                r[i] = r[i + 1] + 1
        return sum(max(l, r) for l, r in zip(l, r))
